Here's a possible angle on the [[Function Attitude]]s.

Fi: Give me anything, and I can always find a way to see it as part of the great plan where everything exists to serve a living purpose.

Te: Show me anything, and I can always measure it and compare it against alternatives.

Si: Show me anything, and I can always see a way that it might get past the barriers we create to protect ourselves against the unpredictable.

Ne: Give me anything, and I can always incorporate it into something greater.

Fe: Show me anyone, and I can tell you where their loyalties lie and how they're showing each other that they've cast their lot together.

Ti: Let me get my hands on anything, and I can figure out how it works.

Se: Show me anything, and I can tell you if it's hip or not.

Ni: Show me anything, and I can see through it to the ''real'' reality that lurks behind.
