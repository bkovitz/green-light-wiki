p. 298: "Another interesting example (of the wholistic and imaginal character of [[Introverted Thinking]]) is the head of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan. Many of Farrakhan's speeches suggest a classic INTP perspective, in that he believes the structure of American culture deforms and degrades the self-understanding of its Black constituents.  Moreover, his manner of defending his ideas is not analytical but analogical, designed to unify his audience in terms of shared contextual experience.

"Whatever may be said about Farrakhan's views or politics, his process of thought tells us something about [[Introverted Thinking]]'s prophetic power.  At the societal level, this function will bear the burden of moral imperatives a culture has not acknowledged, keeping the outward face of law in touch with the immediate experience of real people."

= Why not INFJ? =

The above passage is rather surprising.  Wouldn't an emphasis on how people's culture affects their self-perceptions, and an attempt to change those self-perceptions by looking beyond the culturally available options, fit much better [[Lenore]]'s conception of [[Introverted Intuition]], especially when related to secondary [[Extraverted Feeling]]?

So how does [[Lenore]] arrive at INTP?

She seems to emphasize two things: Farrakhan's rhetorical style and an emphasis on first-hand experience.  Of course, she's trying to illustrate [[Introverted Thinking]] here, as an attitude that emphasizes first-hand experience and understanding without regard to shared categories or myths of culture.

== Declaring the social contract null and void ==

Much of Farrakhan's rhetoric seems to revolve around the idea that an equitable social contract would give blacks benefits in proportion to what they give, but that actually blacks are propping up the social system without getting much in return, and are therefore not bound by the American social contract.

Why is that not tertiary Ti trying to trump secondary Fe from the "higher" perspective of Ni?

One possibility is that [[Lenore]] characterizes [[Introverted Intuition]] in terms of an attitude of ''relativity'' of perspectives, especially the attitude of granting the validity of multiple, incompatible viewpoints.  So perhaps she is distinguishing between [[Introverted Thinking]] as leading you to give priority to a perspective derived from first-hand experience and [[Introverted Intuition]] as leading you see things at a second-hand remove, through the intermediary of representations each of which reflects only a part of the whole.

That, in turn, raises the broader question of why so many people who test INTJ seem obsessed with rendering judgements from an ''independent'' perspective.  And of course bemoaning the existence of power and power structures that keep people down, especially by setting up a cultural language that encourages some people to see themselves as inferior to others, seems to be an especially common pastime of people who test INFJ.

Any other thoughts?

== Independent perspective vs. first-hand perspective ==

@@i23
Wouldn't a great deal of INFJ rhetoric be well characterized as follows? (1) an Ni attitude of seeing biases from an attitude experienced as independent or unbiased, (2) an Fe emphasis on self-definition through social relationship and obligation created by a social contract that you did not originate, (3) a radically Ti perspective of trying to ''point out'' (give people first-hand knowledge of) facts that go against or cannot be expressed in terms of the social fictions that keep the society running, thereby giving outside-the-law legitimacy to exempting oneself from the social contract, and (4) a loathing of Se attitudes that people are to be defined by surface appearances combined with an obsession with the power of surface appearances.

To that, Farrakhan would add an inferior-Se approach of trying to project an image of physical strength, intimidating opponents through viscerally felt fear that he and his followers will "rise up" and destroy their oppressors.  Aren't Farrakhan's attempts to be intimidating, suggesting physical violence without explicitly threatening, typical of tertiary and inferior Se?

== Inferior Fe? ==

Lots of people who test ISTP and INTP seem pretty obsessed with modifying the shared social language so that the things that, in their minds, deserve respect actually get respect.  For example, the [[slashdot http://slashdot.org]] idea that since Linux is the better, more elegant operating system, it and the people who designed it and appreciate it ought to be respected as the best.  This obsession with getting respect, not by earning it according to current criteria by which people really grant respect, but by changing the very ways in which people grant respect, seems classically inferior-Fe.

Could Farrakhan's rhetoric be driven by inferior-Fe in that way?

Here are two reasons why it doesn't quite fit.  (1) Farrakhan is not obsessed with getting respect for himself or for blacks in white people's eyes.  He is not trying to change the cultural language of respect, he's trying to convince the disrespected to see beyond that language and stop playing along with it.

(2) The Linux-geek argument is concerned primarily with the ''intrinsic'' superiority of Linux, by virtue of its purely internal elegance.  This internal elegance is the guiding light.  The overriding moral imperative is to mold your mind to match the true way that things fit together, no matter how difficult or time-consuming this is.  The reason Linux has no mass-market appeal is because it requires such a huge investment in time to understand and appreciate it ''on its own terms.''  That's the usual ITP argument: people should respect the elegant because it's elegant.  Or in other words, the cultural language of Fe ought to be redefined to honor the things I've discovered through relentless Ti refinement in one domain.  (See [[Larry Groznic]].)

Farrakhan's argument, rather, concerns ''unfairness'', ''obligation'', and ''lies''.  He accuses white society of being unfair, not living up to its obligations, and spinning a cultural vocabulary of lies.  He offers his ideas as an impersonal or objective account of the situation, but there is nothing impersonal about his subject matter.  It is all and entirely the ways in which people enter into mutual obligation and accusations that some have failed to live up to those obligations.

= A wild hypothesis to explain the INTP/INFJ connection =

Here's yet another take on all this.  There's widely observed anecdotal evidence that people who test INTP and people who test INFJ often have a natural rapport.  Some do and some don't, of course, but INTPs often report that many INFJs actually can understand and intelligently think about and apply the ideas they offer and explain through their crazy [[Holistic Spiraling]] rhetoric.  They communicate on the same wavelength.

Hypothesis: the INTPs and INFJs who have this rapport might actually both be Lenore-INTPs, some of whom come out INFJ on type tests because they're friendly people who like to keep their lives organized.  The INFJs with whom typical INTPs don't have that rapport would be actual Lenore-INFJs: they're the ones who regularly accuse INTPs of trying to set themselves up as sole authorities, hear all lines of reasoning strictly through the filter of "Ignoring all the content, what kind of relationship is this person trying to establish?", etc.  (See the [[Rhetorical Clash]] described on [[Introverted Perception]].)

= Hypothesis: ENTJ =

Yet another angle on Farrakhan may be that he's an ENTJ of the "cult leader" variety.

Notice that even though his rhetoric is somewhat complex, he offers ''facts'' as ''definitively'' proving his points.  Here was the social contract, here are facts about how it was violated, we have been cheated, ''quod erat demonstrandum.''

INTP rhetoric swirls around, hitting things from many angles, no one fact proving anything.  The "holistic" aspect of it is the way the conclusion seems to arise from many, many angles at once; and the conclusion is not anything definitive or that leads you to take one definite fork of a decision vs. another (Je), but rather the conclusion is itself a theory--that is, a ''way of seeing things'' in which every element has a place and all are in logical harmony.  The object of the rhetoric is just to get you to mentally align yourself with an order believed found in reality: to see things a certain way, not to act in a certain way.

There's just nothing like that in Farrakhan.  His rhetoric follows the pretty typical "hard sell" ENTJ style, where facts are adduced with the idea that they prove the conclusion in a single step without ambiguity, and these conclusions force you to choose new tangible ways of responding now that you see how your present ways of responding are maintaining a bad situation.

= "The Purpose of Education" =

A Farrakhan speech from 1993 calling for putting God at the center of education, and teaching self-knowledge, where self-knowledge is especially knowledge of the past accomplishments of your race:
 http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/article_1000.shtml

"One of America’s greatest crimes was and is depriving us totally of the knowledge of self. This is a crime of immeasurable dimension. Having been deprived of the richness of our history deprives us of the springs and motives of human action that would tell us the possibilities that are within us. If you know what your forebears did, then you know the realm of possibility for you. If you are deprived of that history, then you have nothing to connect yourself to as a person. You are left vulnerable to attach yourself to the circumstances you are given, and in a White society everything that is given to us has a Eurocentric perspective that has historically been hostile to Black people."

Isn't the opposition to "attaching yourself to the circumstances you are given" what Lenore would call a J perspective?

"We as Black people never, therefore, get a root in ourselves, but focus instead on White people—their vision and accomplishments—as the standard by which we judge our possibilities. Further, we are subtly and overtly taught that we can never measure up to them and achieve their level of accomplishments because, by nature, we are inferior beings."

Isn't the emphasis on choosing for yourself what to value and think of yourself a classic Ni perspective, especially secondary Ni?

"A new public school system should relate the curriculum to the self. When we see the curriculum as an outgrowth of self, then we can identify with the curriculum, giving us an incentive to learn. In the Muhammad University of Islam school system, our students’ learning is facilitated because they identify with the subjects. They are taught that they are the subject. They are taught, 'I am chemistry.' Not, 'I am a student of chemistry,' rather, 'I am biology. I am economics. I am history. I am mathematics.' When we relate the forces within self to the forces that lie outside the self, this connects us to subjects we are studying in a manner that we can ultimately master these subjects.

"Our bodies are controlled by the mind. So mastering economics should not be as difficult with this thought in mind. This body takes in and separates what is useful, puts it to productive use, and eliminates what is wasteful. Therefore, this body is economics and since I am the master of this body, I can master economics."

Doesn't this sound like something from EST or the [[Landmark Forum]] (presumably some leading examples of wacked-out ENTJ perspectives)?  Saying strange things to yourself like "I am chemistry" in order to change your perceptions and thereby "master the universe" seems like classic Te/Ni: the mind held independent from reality, choosing categories and concepts to reprogram one's ways of responding to reality, rather than the Ti/Ne approach of building categories and concepts out of patterns found widely throughout reality.  "I am chemistry" is not a discovery about chemistry: it's not a pattern of valences, atomic weights, reaction ratios, or anything found within the subject.  It's a choice of words to impose ''onto'' the subject in order to make it serve one's own goals as efficiently as possible.  Isn't this pretty classic ENTJ "cult leader" talk?

On this view, a heavily [[Extraverted]] perspective is in evidence in the form of viewing the world as a place primarily of negotiation between competing interests.  Other people try to define things to serve their purposes so you've got to define things to serve your purposes or you won't be able to push back.  Farrakhan preaches a classic EJ "stick to your guns" negotiation strategy.

Other people try to define things to serve their purposes so you've got to define things to serve your purposes or you won't be able to push back.

Notice the syllogistic [[sophistry http://greenlightwiki.com/sophistry]] in the argument quoted above that starts with "The mind controls the body" and ends with "The mind can master economics."  This is pure word-game reasoning, deductively corralling the conclusion by legalistic/verbal rules that address nothing of the difficulties in learning and understanding economics.

My knowledge of Farrakhan is pretty vague--mostly consisting of sound-bites aired by Rush Limbaugh and other afternoon KFI talk show hosts in the mid 90's.  But, aren't some of his arguments of this form: If you multiply the number of members on the board of the US Federal Reserve by the height (in feet) of the Washington Memorial, you get *exactly* the number of transatlantic voyages during the US slave trade.  Coincidence?

Of course he's trying to persuade the audience that the US social contract was rotten to its very core, and that reminders of this are everywhere if you just open your eyes.  Or as Paul Shanklin, Rush Limbaugh's chief satirist once put it, if you just order the Million Man Math Made Easy seminar today for only $'19'.95.

This sure doesn't seem like "developed" Ni *OR* Ti rhetoric.  Do ENTJs get this weirded out with bizarre symbolism?

= Hypothesis: INTP as a public service =

Perhaps essence of [[Lenore]]'s type guess is that Farrakhan's rhetoric encourages people to look outside the man-made law for solutions to their social problems, and to align themselves instead with a transcendent "natural law"--what [[Lenore]] might call "archetypal truths".

The natural law can only be understood through first-hand experience, but it is experienced as manifest in every day and every moment and is thought to be accessible to all rational beings.  The natural law is not a contract to be signed--not a compromise among many people's interests to make social life definable and workable--but a natural order of things that transcends all personal interests.  It is something to conform your personal interests ''to,'' not a framework within which to negotiate your personal interests in relation to other people.  Whereas the man-made law is a contingent thing, ever shifting as people negotiate changes to it, the natural law is felt to be a "necessary truth", unchanging in its essence even as it appears in infinitely varied manifestations.

So Farrakhan the man may well be an ENTJ, in that he's decisive for empirical reasons that are usually straightforward to articulate and defend (dominant Te) and proselytizes for some vision of how, through choice, we can release more of the infinity of the self (Ni).  On this hypothesis, what [[Lenore]] is talking about his Farrakhan's role in the public arena, "calling to account" the very social contract that binds us as a society--calling it to account by a higher standard, one that we can all perceive by noticing, for ourselves, the patterns that exist all around us.

== [[Beyond Personality]] ==

If this hypothesis is right, it would shed a lot of light on [[Lenore]]'s conception of [[Psychological Type]].  A person's type would have almost nothing to do with their personality (despite the title of the book!).  Rather, a person's type would be how they've "plugged into the social matrix": the role they are playing ''in relation to'' the shared vocabulary of their culture.  Extraverts would be people whose self-definition is in terms defined by their culture; introverts would be people whose self-definition calls upon innate potentialities of self regardless of culture.

To take an [[Extraverted]] stand, then, would be to ''represent'' in some way the cultural consensus--what [[Lenore]] calls "consensual reality":

* Dominant-Se: I will embody what looks good according to the standards of my culture.

* Dominant-Ne: I will embody what emerging within my culture: the unexpressed potential that is ready to burst forth.

* Dominant-Te: I will embody the rules of predictability in terms of which my culture defines its agreements.

* Dominant-Fe: I will embody loyalty to my society, in visible forms that show to all that I'm not just out for myself.

To take an [[Introverted]] stand, then, would be to stand ''against'' or ''beyond'' the shared vocabulary of your culture:

* Dominant-Si: I will represent the hard, representable facts that are relevant to human survival, regardless of whether anyone else recognizes this.

* Dominant-Ni: I will seek what lurks in the shadows of my culture's vocabulary: that which cannot be said.

* Dominant-Ti: I will align myself with the eternal natural order that provides a Law that transcends all man-made laws and authorities: I will learn to see the Law within the infinite forms of its manifestation.

* Dominant-Fi: I will align myself with the life force: I will learn to see in every living creature's actions the expressions of the unique needs of that creature, and honor them no differently from any other manifestation of the life force.

The ''personality'' of someone who takes any of these attitudes could be almost anything at all.  Any [[Dominant Function]] is compatible with being gregarious or shy, conceptual or practical, tough-minded or friendly, or scheduling or free-wheeling, or indeed any other dimensions of personality that one might draw up.

Defined as above, there is little doubt that Farrakhan is taking an INTP attitude.  He primarily calls his society's laws and practices to account by reference to natural law (Ti) and presents himself as the embodiment of radical new changes in his society that will soon emerge when pent-up forces finally break through (Ne).

=Jung Explained?=

Perhaps this last hypothesis--that Lenore's type theory is not about people and their quirks but about how individuals plug into society--explains Jung as well.  One of the most frustrating moments in _Psychological Types_ is when he cacually tosses Charles Darwin and George Cuvier--surely two of the most obvious examples of INTPs in the Keirsean, Meyrsian, Briggsian,... sense--into the Extraverted Thinking bucket with zero explanation.  Actually he does give a reason: "because they speak with facts."  Perhaps our "but... but... what about how Cuvier never saw a bone fragment he couldn't reconstruct an entire species from"-like protestations based on the nitty-gritty of their personalities are irrelevant.  All that matters is their relationship to society in the grand scheme of things.  Cuvier's greatest legacy (in spite of losing the catastrophism versus evolution debate with Darwin) is of course taxonomy, a system of buckets.  Even though he developed this system of buckets with what we might describe as experiential, fromt-the-ground-up, iconoclastic reasoning we associate with T1, the fact remains that Cuvier gave us the buckets we now teach high schoolers to stick animals in when they go on "field" trips to the zoo.  I.e., he provided a Te service to society.

Other Jungianisms that make sense: basically classifying all women as Feeling.

Problem: why does Jung then talk about personality; e.g., Introverted Intuitives being pale, eccentric, irritible etc?

Perhaps this passage from [[Lenore]] explains how it could grow from
a Ti attitude:

p. 295: "In the Renaissance, churches were deliberately constructed
with the idea that their design and structure could align a
worshipper's psyche with a deeper pattern of reality.  The same
principle lies behind the art in traditional Islamic institutions,
whose lines and dimensions are meant to bring one into harmony with
the perfect design of the cosmos."

So perhaps:

(1) Farrakhan's argument is not sophistry but a proposal of a
theory: if you see how the body is chemistry, is economics, etc.,
your psyche would become "aligned" with these subjects.  Once you're
aligned with a subject, it becomes easier to learn.

(2) [[Lenore]] is saying that [[Introverted Thinking]] in general
emphasizes learning by finding that "alignment".  From a Ti
perspective, you try to find "the groove" and ride along with it.
If you're not on that groove, then all seems arbitrary and you
stumble along clumsily.

== Numerological arguments illustrate INTP? ==

Here is one of Farrakhan's most famous pieces of rhetoric, from his
[[speech at the Million-Man March http://www.afn.org/~dks/race/farrakhan-e6.html]] in 1995:

"There in the middle of this mall is the Washington Monument, 555
feet high. But if we put a 1 in front of that 555 feet, we get 1555,

Virginia, as slaves.

of these monuments is 19 feet high.  Abraham Lincoln, the 16th
president, Thomas Jefferson the third president, and 16 and 3 make
19 again. What is so deep about this number 19? Why are we standing
on the Capitol steps today? That number 19, when you have a nine,
you have a womb that is pregnant, and when you have a one standing
by the nine, it means that there's something secret that has to be
unfolded.

"Right here on this mall where we are standing, according to books
written on Washington, D.C., slaves used to be brought right here on
this mall in chains, to be sold up and down the eastern seaboard.
Right along this mall, going over to the White House, our fathers
were sold into slavery. But George Washington, the first president
of the United States, said he feared that before too many years
passed over his head, this slave would prove to become a most
troublesome species of property. Thomas Jefferson said he trembled
for this country when he reflected that God was just and that his
justice could not sleep forever.

"Well, the day that these presidents feared has now come to pass,
for on this mall here we stand in the capital of America, and the
layout of this great city, laid out by a black man, Benjamin
Banneker, this is all placed and based in a secret Masonic ritual,
and at the core of the secret of that ritual is the black man."

Perhaps the structure of this rhetoric is what [[Lenore]] has in mind
when she calls it "not analytical but analogical".  The premises are
fairly clear: a bunch of factoids, mostly about various quantities
that don't seem to have anything to do with each other.  What is the
conclusion?  The conclusion is far from clear, but it seems to be
that "the black man" is at the core of the design of America--that
there is some sort of deep, purposeful, God-driven drama being
played out in America, and these are various hints dropped by God
about what the plan is.

Ignoring the absurdity of the ideas, the rhetoric might appeal to a
first-hand perspective by appealing to the listener's ability to see
a great many things in relation simultaneously: to "get", all at
once, from a vast pattern, what is really going on.  The conclusion
cannot be stated or understood separately from the premises used to
illustrate it or reach it.  That could well be the distinguishing
feature of [[Introverted Thinking]] as opposed to Extraverted
Thinking].  The object of the rhetoric is to get listeners to "align
themselves" with order found in the world: to see things in a
certain way, and therefore think and therefore live in a certain way
that is harmonious with that order.

(The Jamestown factoid is false, by the way.  One of the best-known
dates in U.S. history is 1607, the year settlers arrived in
Jamestown.)

= Hypothesis: ENTJ =

Perhaps Farrakhan is an ENTJ of the "cult leader" variety.

First of all, from a [[Myers-Briggs]] perspective, Farrakhan certainly
comes across as an outgoing, high-energy fellow, though of course we
only see him on stage, where even introverts usually appear
[[Extraverted]].  Somewhere I found something on-line that suggests
that Farrakhan lives a pretty structured, scheduled life, suggesting
that he'd test J.  (Sorry, I didn't keep the URL.  --[[Ben Kovitz]])
That he'd test N and T seems apparent.

Second, the rhetoric is ''so'' nutty, ''so'' incoherent, that
perhaps Farrakhan is simply giving people a snow job.  The
hypothesis proposed in this section is that Farrakhan's rhetoric
shows secondary Ni supporting a Te agenda of grabbing and expanding
social power.  It would be Ni because Farrakhan chooses his words
not to illustrate anything, not to point out anything in the world
that might be enlightening, not to persuade by logic, but for
reasons entirely unrelated to what his words refer to or their
ordinary interpretations.

On this hypothesis, Farrakhan is choosing his words to sound sort of
like a very complex, rational argument, logically assembling
evidence that establishes that there is something big and
conspiratorial and hidden going on, but of course this only fools
people who lack a sense of logic and/or give him a very big benefit
of the doubt.  There is no clearly stated conclusion, because a
clearly stated conclusion could conceivably be put to a test and
possibly refuted.  It's kept vague to create a sense that what he
has to say is too big, too profound, to fit in words: ''any''
attempt to state the message clearly would only cheapen it.

All that sounds like pretty standard smoke-and-mirrors Ni/Se
demagoguery as described in books like ''[[The 48 Laws of Power]].''
Farrakhan is exploiting the connotations of words, the connotations
of high-sounding language, to encourage his audience to enter a sort
of mystic trance where they feel communion with ineffable truth.
The hypnotic music of the words, not their denotation, is the point.

This also seems to fit his more didactic rhetoric, such as telling
yourself nonsense like "I am economics" to make economics easier to
understand.

Farrakhan has, of course, been a pretty formidable power player
during most of his career, grabbing control of the Nation of Islam
after Elijah Muhammad died, pushing Malcolm X out, and holding a
devoted cult following in a relentless hypnotic grip.

A further aspect of Farrakhan's rhetoric is that the ''commitment''
with which he says it aloud is perhaps half the message.  This could
be tertiary Se: demonstrating one's ideas by making it viscerally
clear that one is committed to them enough to play a very hard game
of chicken.  As if to say, "How could I be ''this'' committed if it
wasn't true?"  (I believe I've seen this a bunch in person from
clear-cut ENTJs. --[[Ben Kovitz]])

Against the INTP hypothesis, don't most INTPs continually ''doubt''
what they come up with, continually revisit it from many angles, and
seldom present a conclusion as definitively established by specific
premises?  Most profiles say that, and that's my ([[Ben Kovitz]]'s)
self-experience and experience with other INTPs.  Also, breaking the
referential connection between words and the things they stand
for--using words for purposes other than ''pointing out''--for
example, using them to reprogram yourself by exploiting their
connotations--is anathema to most INTPs.  Reasoning by analogy is
anathema.  Most INTPs would feel called upon to point out the brazen
illogic in Farrakhan's rhetoric.  Then again, whatever type
Farrakhan is, he's surely not a typical example.

It's hard to say whether the ENTJ or INTP theory better fits the
facts of Farrakhan's rhetoric, though.  He'd be an insane, idiotic
INTP if his rhetoric is sincere; if he's engaging in such wanton
illogic knowingly, he'd be a deliberate deceiver taking a ruthless
ENTJ attitude.

So Farrakhan the man may well be an ENTJ, in that he's decisive for
empirical reasons that he could easily articulate (dominant Te) and
proselytizes for some vision of how, through choice, we can release
more of the infinity of the self (Ni).  On this hypothesis, what
[[Lenore]] is calling INTP is Farrakhan's (perhaps knowingly
fraudulent) role in the public arena, "calling to account" the very
social contract that binds us as a society--calling it to account by
a higher standard, one that we can all perceive by noticing, for
ourselves, patterns that exist all around us in our histories and
cultures.

Perhaps this last hypothesis--that Lenore's type theory is not about people and their quirks but about how individuals plug into society--explains Jung as well.  One of the most frustrating moments in ''[[Psychological Types]]'' is when he cacually tosses [[Charles Darwin]] and [[George Cuvier]]--surely two of the most obvious examples of INTPs in the Keirseyan, Myersian, Briggsian,... sense--into the [[Extraverted Thinking]] bucket with zero explanation.  Actually he does give a reason: "because they speak with facts."  Perhaps our "but... but... what about how Cuvier never saw a bone fragment he couldn't reconstruct an entire species from"-like protestations based on the nitty-gritty of their personalities are irrelevant.  All that matters is their relationship to society in the grand scheme of things.  Cuvier's greatest legacy (in spite of losing the catastrophism versus evolution debate with Darwin) is of course taxonomy, a system of buckets.  Even though he developed this system of buckets with what we might describe as experiential, fromt-the-ground-up, iconoclastic reasoning we associate with Ti, the fact remains that Cuvier gave us the buckets we now teach high schoolers to stick animals in when they go on "field" trips to the zoo.  I.e., he provided a Te service to society.

= Hypothesis: ENTP =

Yet another way to make sense of Farrakhan in terms of [[Lenore]]-attitudes might be ENTP.  Farrakhan could be a black militant version of [[Johnny Carson]]'s character [[Floyd R. Turbo]].

The incoherence, blatant pseudo-logic, and willingness to toss out the speculative as if it were proven might actually be a fairly common way for undeveloped ENTPs to grab and hold attention.  The "calling to account" and even the rhetoric that aims at alignment with an order that can't be described independently of the evidence for it, would be clear-cut Ti.  The reason for the illogic--the sheer incompetence of the reasoning--would be that it's fairly undeveloped secondary Ti.

A problem with this hypothesis is that the cosmic order that Farrakhan preaches and tries to illustrate "analogically" is suggested to be morally binding, trumping all other concerns.  That would a genuinely dominant-Ji attitude.  Of course, preaching that ''other'' people should be bound by the cosmic moral code, while violating it oneself, is probably not unusual for ENTPs.
