'''What this wiki is about'''

This wiki is for understanding [[Lenore Thomson]]'s ideas about psychological type, mostly as described in her book [[Personality Type: An Owner's Manual http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877739870]], and partly as she's talked about them on various Internet discussion lists.

By exegesis, we do not simply mean "What did Lenore mean?" but rather "What is she talking about?"  We don't aim to nail down precisely what is or was in Lenore's head.  Rather, we aim to see for ourselves some of the same things that she is seeing and describing.  Naturally, each person will see such things in his or her own way.

The purpose of this wiki is not to settle on any definite interpretation of Lenore's writing, but to learn whatever we happen to learn by trying to articulate Lenore's ideas in our own words and through our own observations, and by watching other people's attempts to do the same.

In accord with wiki tradition, when people propose opposing ideas, the wiki renders no verdict.  Rather than attempting to have the wiki's text be an official statement of the settled truth of a matter, we encourage you to post all the competing ideas as clearly and persuasively as possible.

''Even if an interpretation turns out to be clearly wrong,'' we still want it on this wiki.  This wiki is a record of people's thoughts as they try to make sense of Lenore's writing: the surprising insights, the dead ends, the great ideas, the dumb ideas, everything.  Nothing on this wiki is a definite or official statement of what [[Lenore Thomson]] meant by anything she ever said.

While we eagerly welcome nearly any contribution of any Lenore-related ideas, we're not interested in judgements of Lenore's ideas, whether positive or negative.  You're invited to explore and articulate the ideas, and leave judgement to the reader.

'''What is a wiki?'''

A wiki is a web site that lets you edit its pages.  It's sort of like an on-line bulletin board.  To experiment, see [[Sand Box]].

The first wiki ever was [[Ward Cunningham's Wiki http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges]].  It was where many of the ideas of [[Extreme Programming http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices]] were hashed out, as well as many software development patterns.  [[Ward's Wiki http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges]] still thrives as a meeting place for the software world to discuss culture, techniques, and ideas of all sorts.

Wikis, like [[Extreme Programming http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices]], involve a special style of collaboration: unilateral cooperation.  Each collaborator edits without asking permission from the other authors.  There is little or no planning or discussion: you just edit the text itself.  This results in an anonymously, collectively written work that is never "complete" but just keeps on growing and improving.  

So you are invited to modify any text on the wiki you like, to make it clearer, more interesting, more stimulating.  It doesn't matter who the "original" author of the text is.  You are invited to improve it however you like.  That might be as simple as fixing a typo or as involved as splitting text into several pages or rewriting it from scratch.  The one proviso is to please never "improve" some text by having it no longer express an idea that you believe is mistake.  The wiki expresses all ideas that anyone found interesting or persuasive--rightly or wronglt.  The improvements are to express the ideas so they are more stimulating to readers, and to add more ideas, never to take away.

The name "wiki" comes from the Hawaiian word ''wikiwiki'', which means "quick".  Editing a wiki page is quick and easy, and requires no knowledge of HTML.

[[Lenore Thomson]] is the author of [[Personality Type: An Owner's Manual http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877739870/ref=ase_greenlightwik-20]], a book that takes the [[Myers-Briggs]] personality type system back to its roots in [[Jungian psychology http://greenlightwiki.com/jung-exegesis]].

[[Lenore]]'s book is simply written, filled with examples and analogies from popular TV shows like Star Trek and The X Files.  But there's a lot to it, more than meets the eye.  She is the first popular author to go into depth about what the [[function attitude]]s are, and she turns [[Myers-Briggs]] from a system of personality classification to a path of personal growth, something like the [[Enneagram http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/]].  Perhaps, buried in her book, you can even find some startlingly original takes on perennial questions of philosophy and religion.

This wiki is a place where we explore what [[Lenore Thomson]] is saying by trying to put it into our own words.  The text on this wiki is written by anyone who cares to post, and edited and rewritten by anyone who cares to edit and rewrite.  We welcome all [[Lenore]]-related ideas: what's posted here is not necessarily correct, it's not checked or approved by [[Lenore Thomson]], and it's not necessarily any clearer than [[Lenore]]'s original writing.  If you find what looks like an internal contradiction here, it probably is.  We make no attempt to be consistent; we're looking for many different angles on [[Lenore]]'s stuff.  The only [[Lenore]]-related topic we're not interested in is judgements of whether her ideas are right or wrong.  We leave that to the reader.

[[Lenore]]'s book is simply written, filled with examples and analogies from popular TV shows like Star Trek and The X Files.  But there's a lot to it, more than meets the eye.  She is the first popular author to go into depth about what the [[function attitude]]s are, and she turns [[Myers-Briggs]] from a system of personality classification to a path of personal growth, something like the [[Enneagram http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/]].  Perhaps, buried in her book, you can even find some new takes on perennial questions of philosophy and religion.

[[Lenore Thomson]]'s book is simply written, filled with examples and analogies from popular TV shows like Star Trek and The X Files.  But there's a lot to it, more than meets the eye.  She is the first popular author to go into depth about what the [[function attitude]]s are, and she turns [[Myers-Briggs]] from a system of personality classification to a path of personal growth, something like the [[Enneagram http://www.enneagraminstitute.com/]].

We don't really know quite what to make of her book--hence this web site.

This wiki is a place where we explore what [[Lenore Thomson]] is saying by trying to put it into our own words--[[exegesis]].  The text on this wiki is written by anyone who cares to post, and edited and rewritten by anyone who cares to edit and rewrite.  We welcome all [[Lenore]]-related ideas: what's posted here is not necessarily correct, it's not checked or approved by [[Lenore Thomson]], and it's not necessarily any clearer than [[Lenore]]'s original writing.  If you find what looks like an internal contradiction here, it probably is.  We make no attempt to be consistent; we're looking for many different angles on [[Lenore]]'s stuff.  The only [[Lenore]]-related topic we're not interested in is judgements of whether her ideas are right or wrong.  We leave that to the reader.

[[Lenore Thomson]]'s book is simply written, filled with examples and analogies from popular TV shows like Star Trek and The X Files.  Even so, it can be maddeningly difficult to understand.  She touches on a wide swath of deep and broad issues from ancient philosophy to Sufism to contemporary pop culture.  She seems to have something very definite in mind by the many [[terms with nonobvious meanings]].  She never really quite defines them, though, and it's difficult to pin down her meaning.
