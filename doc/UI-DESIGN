Each wiki page:

   Search
   Title
   Text of page
   Serif font
   Larger font
   Off-white (Cream?) bg
   Sun Tarot

   Buttons:
      Edit
      History

   Sidebar/Navbar
      Home
      Recent Changes
      All Pages
      
Diffs:

   The old way: show a vertical yellow "change bar" to the left of
   each paragraph that was changed since the previous revision of
   the page. This was done with CSS.

   The new way: more like Wikipedia. Details TBD.
      Rationale: we no longer expect the wiki to be a place of
      conversation. Mostly people will read it, not edit it.

New features:

   Tagging on pages

   Marginal notes
