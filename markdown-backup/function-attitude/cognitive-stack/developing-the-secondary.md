Here are some ideas about the kinds of shifts in perspective that [Lenore](../../typologists/lenore-thomson) might be referring to when she speaks of using the [Secondary Function](../../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function) to support a dominant "agenda" vs. using the [Secondary Function](../../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function) to genuinely broaden your perspective.

## Examples

_Ti:_ Spinning the truth vs. Seeing the whole truth

_Fi:_ Pleasure-seeking vs. Seeing what is truly good

_Si:_ Seeking facts to support a purpose vs. Allowing yourself to see whatever facts are there

_Ni:_ Seeing through smoke and mirrors vs. Seeing the validity of other perspectives

Deconstructing an opposing view vs. using a shared vocabulary to communicate your own view

_Te:_ Judging vs. Navigating

_Fe:_ Serving vs. Negotiating

_Se:_ Idle amusement vs. Being present

_Ne:_ Idle curiosity vs. Opportunism

## Advice Columnists

> p. 84: "A good percentage of the questions (that appear in columns like Dear Abby and Ann Landers) are from people contending with what might be called a crisis of the [Secondary Function](../../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function). Although these columnists don't use typological terms, they invariably persuade their correspondents to make the necessary shift in attitude.

A widow whose husband was her best and only friend (Introverted Judgement) is advised to look outside and explore new options (Extraverted Perception)."

Talk radio host Laura Schlessinger's favorite strategy with a caller is to apply an infinite regression of "So what?"'s to the feared consequences that would result from the caller taking her advice. The question "So what?" seems to strike directly at the [Dominant Function](../../dominant-function), leaving it dazed and speechless, perhaps forcing a person to reverse attitudes.

## How do INTJs develop Te?

*Hypothesis:* By developing a bargaining position consisting of the ability to promise and deliver useful results that other people understand and value.

(This is essentially an elaboration of the [Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis](../../exegeses/introversion-extraversion/saints-and-politicians-exegesis).)

Acquiring capabilities that other people can understand and value moves you into a position where you can see more to do in the world than declaring it unworthy of superior beings like yourself. It radically transforms your whole perspective on life. You might still retain and enjoy the "commentator" pose, but your observations will be greatly enriched by real experience as a participant.

When you can offer people something better than "I can point out that you're not omniscient" or "I can accuse your actions of being tainted by self-interest" or "I can say that your conclusions are not justified on the basis of perfectly rock-solid foundations", you'll satisfy your need for power. You won't need to come up with rationalizations for why you're powerless or why people ignore you, nor will you be tempted to take up kick-boxing. You'll have a bit of real influence in the world, and people will have good reason to listen to you. You may even find something beneficial to do with that influence.

Where *will* negotiating with other people lead you? You have no idea until you get there. There are some things that cannot be known by foresight. All you can do is pick some small, feasible goal, bring everything you've got, and achieve it. And then you'll be in a new position, able to see new options—options that were invisible from the position of total forethought.

### A possible problem with this hypothesis

Doesn't this amount to selling out? If you're carrying an ineffable vision, how is learning some pedestrian trade going to help you bring that to life?

Perhaps the answer is unknowable before you engage. The answer may be that the ineffable vision is half empty verbiage, and only worldly experience will give you the perspective to see that for yourself. The answer may also be that even a pedestrian trade is miraculous once you experience it. The answer may be that your ability to see from many angles at once gives you a way to transform seemingly mundane things into something much more wonderful than most people would think possible. You'll know by finding out. The only thing that's clear at the outset is that you'll be good at it.

The answer is that there are enough trades out there that whatever knowledge, etc... you've accumulated can be bartered. (If you're fortunate, they'll even pay you to do what you most want to do. If you're not that fortunate, you may even decide to make your own way/business.)

### A Trap

A peculiar way that some INTJs develop a bargaining position is by finding a niche deep within a world where no negotiation is necessary, like academia. There, one is given some very low expectations to meet, and then one can "play Te": no matter what you see or read, you find a way to interpret it in terms of some theory that lets you "objectively" rule it lacking or a sham. Postmodernism and analytic philosophy might be prime examples of these INTJ-traps. ("Introverted" Te would figure into it because of the way that everything gets funneled into predefined categories and criteria.)

If you're happy there, maybe there's no need to escape the trap. But if you sense some calling within yourself to make a contribution, or just to exist more fully, you need to bring Te into the game in a more genuinely extraverted way: by accomplishing tangible goals.

### Another trap

Another way that secondary Te can become an introverted trap is when you manage your affairs so that nothing unexpected can happen, and you live your life by "phoning it in". The real you is safely held back, "tolerating", "accepting", "making do", "rising above it", never really enjoying or finding fulfillment in daily life. You're not really there.

A common example is INTJs in managerial jobs who keep everything in both work and family life completely predictable. Family and co-workers feel "straitjacketed" around you: they know that everything they say will be re-interpreted in terms of some hard-set criteria. You find yourself viewing every new thing through a very narrow lens. Through that lens, everyone looks appallingly stupid—the [Daria Morgendorfer](../../../typing/media/characters/daria-morgendorfer) worldview. You've become oblivious to the fact that most of what the world offers has little to do with the narrow game you're so skilled at managing. Here, a small dose of worldly power has become a tool to avoid living.

Perhaps the only way out of these sorts of traps is to quit and do something radically different—something that will call upon you to engage more of yourself, learn new concepts, and deal with things that are not so easily controllable. When you are in complete control, you've outgrown the job. Then again, maybe it's a pretty comfortable, workable trap and therefore not such a bad way to live.
