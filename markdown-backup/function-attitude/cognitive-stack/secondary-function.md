An alternate or auxiliary [Function Attitude](../../fundamentals/function-attitude) in addition to one's [Dominant Function](./dominant-function).

The **Secondary Function** gives extraverts access to something beyond what is immediately apparent or applicable; and it gives introverts access to public, worldly matters. A person's Secondary Function doesn't directly conflict with the person's [Dominant Function](../dominant-function) even though it's [Oriented](../../sign-interpretation/orienting) by the opposite world (extraverted/introverted).

One of [Lenore](../../typologists/lenore-thomson)'s [Main Propositions](../../fundamentals/main-propositions) seems to be that the Secondary Function often provides a person's main path of growth, once they've established a definite personalityâ€”one strong enough to start running into self-created limitations.

Some explorations of how this might work are on [Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis](../../exegeses/introversion-extraversion/saints-and-politicians-exegesis), [Place-Your-Stakes Exegesis](../../exegeses/introversion-extraversion/place-your-stakes-exegesis), and [Checks and Balances](../../checks-and-balances).
