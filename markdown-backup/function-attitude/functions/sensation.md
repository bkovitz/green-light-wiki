## Proposed Definitions

### Sensation as [Semiotic Attitude](../../semiotic-attitude): What you see is what you get

Se says that the world is filled with stimuli, and all you have to do is let yourself react to them. No need to think, just react. The meaning of a sign is what your gut tells you you should do in response. If it's not here or not now, it's not real.

Si says that the world is so overwhelmingly filled with stimuli that you need something stable to focus on or you'll just be permanently overwhelmed and confused.

### Another definition: context is irrelevant to meaning

Another definition: from an S attitude, the facts are the facts regardless of anything else, and facts regardless of context ought to command your attention. For example, $100 in the bank is $100 in the bank: that is a fact, regardless of anything else. All facts are independent. The fact that you have $100 in the bank implies no other facts.

From an Se attitude, one seeks stimulation by things that can be understood here and now, so you can respond to them here and now, without regard for far-flung concerns or how they relate to anything else. If someone is flirting with you, you flirt back. If that has unexpected consequences, you don't worry about them now, you deal with them when and if they come up.

From an Si attitude, one seeks stabilization rather than stimulation: well aware that $100 in the bank might be worth very little depending on other conditions, you look for ways to set things up so that you _can_ safely depend on that fact holding its meaning despite changing conditions. You learn to anticipate unexpected consequences (mostly bad ones, mostly learned from concrete experiences with failures) and plan or design to prevent them from coming about.
