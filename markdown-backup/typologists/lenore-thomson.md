See [What is Psychological Type?](https://www.personalitypathways.com/thomson/index.html), an interview with Lenore outlining the overarching ideas in [Personality Type: An Owner's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Type-Practical-Understanding-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00KLFBMKG).

See also _"Implications of Beebe's Model from a Neurological Standpoint"[^1]_, a discussion by Lenore of how [John Beebe](./john-beebe)'s notion of "complexes" that correspond to [function attitudes](../fundamentals/function-attitude) might relate to different kinds of information processing going on in the brain. This article might shed a lot of light on how Lenore conceives of type, [function attitudes](../fundamentals/function-attitude), and how they relate and don't relate.
