## Hypothesis: It's [Extraverted Feeling](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling) restoring friendship

A competitive sport is a forum for people to let out their aggressive, competitive side in a controlled way. During the game, you "ask no quarter and give no quarter". Within the limits of the rules and the spirit of the game, you push for every advantage against your opponent. You exploit every weakness you can find. For example, in tennis, if you see that your opponent has a weak backhand, you hit as many shots to his backhand as you can.

At the end of the game, it's time to put an end to this relationship of ruthless hostility and restore friendship. The gesture of shaking hands is socially recognized as a gesture of friendship. The act of shaking hands calms you down. It reshapes the way you respond to each other. Because both parties shake hands, each sees that the other is willing to make this signal. And thus a new relationship is created: a relationship created by and expressed in the social language. Through the act of shaking hands, we *understand* that the other team is grateful to have had us as an opponent, and now the hostilities are over.

## Hypothesis: It's [Introverted Feeling](../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-feeling) transcending conflict

The behaviour of shaking hands at the end of the game could also be motivated by introverted feeling. The 'game' itself may represent the totality of the Fe social arena, with all its scrappings and conflicts. However, the ending of this game creates a space in which people can demonstrate their underlying goodwill to one another regardless of their (as viewed by Fi) superficial relationship in the field.
