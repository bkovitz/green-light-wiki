Here's a possible angle on theÂ [function attitudes](../fundamentals/function-attitude):

_Fi_: Give me anything, and I can always find a way to see it as a one-of-a-kind living thing answering its own, unique calling.

_Te_: Give me anything, and I can always measure it and compare it against alternatives.

_Si_: Give me anything, and I can always collect and share a trillion haphazardly related facts about it.

_Ne_: Give me anything, and I can always incorporate it into something greater.

_Fe_: Show me anyone, and I can always tell you where their loyalties lie and how they're showing each other that they've cast their lot together.

_Ti_: Let me get my hands on anything, and I can always figure out how it works.

_Se_: I can't tell you anything until you show me. And then I'll know everything there is to know, because it'll be obvious.

_Ni_: Let me see you look at anything, and I'll see how the way in which you're looking at it is distorting your perception of the real thing.
