Some people find the notion of swear words nonsensical. Words that are part of the language, but you're not supposed to say them? Then why have them in the language? Why do people get so upset about people saying certain arbitrary combinations of sounds? What *harm* could there possibly be in saying a certain word—a word that means exactly the same thing as a "polite" synonym?

## Hypothesis: Swear words are [extraverted feeling](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling) vocabularity for anti-socialness

In terms of [extraverted feeling](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling), it's easy to understand why swear words exist. They are socially recognized signs that display your unwillingness to play along with the social rules that keep your less-social instincts out of play. Saying a swear word is an act of social defiance—an act that's recognizably defiant, which is to say, it's an element of the social vocabulary through which you can express defiance in a way that anyone in your culture can understand.

It's no accident that the literal meanings of swear words mostly have to do with sex and bodily waste. The world of extraverted [judgement](../../function-attitude/functions/judgement) is mostly concerned with managing the public sphere. And mostly that involves keeping instinctive, "right-brain", animalistic urges out of the public sphere, so that people can come together in an orderly manner, not as snarling brutes. To be easily recognized as opposed to that willing self-limitation for the sake of public orderliness, words that refer to the most animalistic sides of human nature are the most likely choice to become swear words.
