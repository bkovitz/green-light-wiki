Ti: Affirming the consequent (the harmony that I see is the only harmony possible). Induction errors.

Te: Straw man, false dichotomy (both involve plugging things into a conceptual framework even when they don't fit), "Some people might disagree" (i.e. confusing truth with agreement). *Ad ignorantiam*, because it confuses the truth of a proposition with whether it has been proven or disproven in an extraverted arena. Deduction errors.

Se: *Non sequitur* (stark raving illogic), *ad baculum, ad populum* (confusing truth with willingness to go along).

Fe: *Ad verecundiam.*

Ni: *Ad ignorantiam,* equivocation. "Hemming and hawing" (insisting on derivation over judgement)? Slothful induction (denying the conclusion of a strong inductive argument). _[Failure to Elucidate](https://web.archive.org/web/20070115092016/http://www.datanation.com/fallacies/define/failure.htm)_.

Fi: *Ad misericordiam,* confusing truth with justice.

Ne: Equivocation? Hasty generalization?

Si: Appeal to tradition? Complexification?

All the extraverted attitudes favor *ad hominem.* So does Ni because it leads to accusations of bias or ulterior motives (confusing the truth of a statement with the "objectivity" or lack thereof of the speaker).
