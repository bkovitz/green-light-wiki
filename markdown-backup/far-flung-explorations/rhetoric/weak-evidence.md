_Hypothesis_: When people use very weak evidence to justify a conclusion, they are likely taking an attitude of [Intuition](../../function-attitude/functions/intuition).

From a [Sensing](../../function-attitude/functions/sensation) attitude, only strong evidence will do. Any conclusion that is not straightforwardly clear is "neither here nor there," not reliable enough to use as a guide to action.

## Weak evidence in Extraverted Intuition

[Extraverted Intuition](../../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-intuition) can be seen when people use weak evidence to suggest a positive possibility. The possibility will require further investigation or experimentation to see if it's real or exactly what it is.

For example, "Look at all these women walking around here dressed up like models. Maybe that department store is running an audition. And maybe some of these women need an agent. Department stores are running into problems with sales these days. They're going to need a new approach. Maybe they could be talked into using models that look like normal people."

A small piece of evidence suggests a larger trend, a change in the system, a wave that you could ride. Where it leads, nobody can tell right now. The missing parts of the picture can only be guessed at for now; they will become apparent in time.

## Weak evidence in Introverted Intuition

[Introverted Intuition](../../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) can be seen when people use weak evidence, or even contrary evidence, to justify that a hidden force is setting up a misleading appearance. The signs are being made to support a conclusion, only because something is setting up those signs or engineering the relationship to the conclusion, not because there is really a necessary connection between sign and conclusion.

For example, Freud's suggestion if you find no evidence of psychological repression, that proves that the person is engaged in so much repression that they're hiding it perfectly. Here, a complete absence of evidence is all the evidence that it takes to prove the hidden force at work.

Conspiracy theories are usually the fruit of introverted intuition. Inconclusive evidence for the conventional theory is taken as proof of the conspiracy. If things don't quite add up (they never do), that proves that someone is lying. "It sure looks like a mortgage crisis, doesn't it? That's exactly what they want you to think! If enough people think it's a mortgage crisis and demand action, that'll empower the Federal Reserve to take more control over the economy. So, the supposed 'mortgage crisis' has actually been deliberately set up by the Federal Reserve: it looks like they're helping poor people buy homes, but really they're helping rich people solidify their stranglehold on everything."

The existence of a partial picture (all we ever have) is taken as evidence that the missing parts are being hidden to serve the interests of some party. The public face has been crafted to hide something; you can tell what's being hidden if you're attuned to the patternâ€”especially, if you know who is benefiting. Describe the way that the evidence is being used to support a conclusion, and you will have a clue to what the evidence is hiding.
