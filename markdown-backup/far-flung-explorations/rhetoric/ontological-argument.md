Cogito, ergo sum: I think, therefore I am.

Basically states that the capacity for thought is necessary for thought to exist. a tautology.

Answer to below: I'm not referring to an argument for or against god, but to the "nature of being" form of the argument, and am reducing said argument to the most axiomatic form I can currently think of. — [Robert Evans](https://web.archive.org/web/20101218120702/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Robert_Evans)

_Robert, the exposition below doesn't limit itself to arguments for the existence of God (and can't apply to arguments against God), so I don't see the connection. Also, if you mean something so different from what is usually meant by "ontological argument", how about using a different term? —[Ben Kovitz](https://web.archive.org/web/20101218120702/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Ben_Kovitz)_

## The ontological argument

The above is not the ontological argument. There are a [number of versions](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/) of the ontological argument, including [one by Descartes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/), but they all go like this:

"I have an idea of something in my head."  
"Therefore that something exists (not just as an idea in my head)."

[Saint Anselm](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/anselm/) was the first to come out with this, and it's what [Jung](../../typologists/carl-jung) is referring to in paras. 59-67 of *Psychological Types*, Anselm's argument is still the most famous: "God is a being greater than which nothing can be conceived. If God were only an idea in my head, I could conceive of something greater, because really existing is greater than just being an idea. Therefore God really does exist."

## [Introverted intuition](../../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) in extreme form

*Hypothesis:* The ontological argument expresses an extreme, unmitigated form of [introverted intuition](../../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition), with secondary [extraverted thinking](../../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-thinking) used to play a mental chess game rather than for real stakes. The fact that an idea is in my head *proves* that something in reality must correspond to it.

You can still see this frequently in the world of analytic philosophy, in talk about "possible worlds" and "logical possibilities." The reasoning, though seldom stated explicitly, is that "If I can put an idea into my head, say, by juxtaposing words, then *something* in reality must correspond to it, even if it's only a possible way that things could be. And therefore before we judge that possibility to be false, we must have some argument to show that it's false." This is putting the objects of the mind first, as the surest guide to reality—over and above just looking at stuff and thinking about what you actually find.

_I once had a strange conversation with a graduate student in mathematics. He said that he thought comments improved the readability of source code for computer programs, and that every program ought to have them. I said that that sounds very reasonable, and indeed I used to both preach and practice it myself, but I know of a certain experience that leads people to discover another way of making programs readable, which involves very little use of commenting. I was about to tell him what it was, when he cut me off. He said that when he looks at this in his head, he perceives that comments make programs more readable, and no experience could possibly shed any new light on the matter. His imagination was the court of highest appeal, and that settled the matter. —[Ben Kovitz](https://web.archive.org/web/20101218120702/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Ben_Kovitz)_

Of course the ontological argument is absurd, narrow-minded sophistry. It's easy to criticize, as both [Jung](../../typologists/carl-jung) and Kant do (see  [Psychological Types](psychological_types), paras. 63-65). [Jung](../../typologists/carl-jung)'s point is that while the ontological argument is nonsense from the standpoint of logic, it expresses a certain psychological orientation: one where an *idea* (something of the psychic world) seems to carry greater reality than concrete objects directly observed (things of the material world). And this psychological orientation, which puts ideas ahead of sensory experience, is what [Jung](../../typologists/carl-jung) calls introversion.

Putting words or concepts first, ahead of concrete, experienced reality, actually doesn't square very well with [Lenore](../../typologists/lenore-thomson)'s concepts of Ti or Fi. She takes the use of signs and symbols (like words) as your ultimate anchor, rather than reference points in reality, as the distinctive feature of J attitudes (see [Truth-and-Language Exegesis](../../exegeses/truth-and-language-exegesis) and [Introverted Perception](../../function-attitude/functions/perception#introverted-perception)). Ti and Fi, for [Lenore](../../typologists/lenore-thomson), use—actually, *require*—first-hand experience with concrete things to serve as their ultimate reference points. It's Ni and Si that have "no reference points" but an inner world of signs and symbols.

## Introversion in extreme form

*Hypothesis:* The ontological argument expresses *any* introverted attitude in extreme, unmitigated form. This hypothesis, in other words, is that [Lenore](../../typologists/lenore-thomson) and [Jung](../../typologists/carl-jung) are actually in alignment here.

[Johannes Kepler](https://web.archive.org/web/20101218120702/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Johannes_Kepler) might provide an illustration. Kepler was presumably an INTP, based on his [holistic spiraling](../../function-attitude/functions/perception#holistic_spiraling), "I'm going to tell you every dead end of my search before I get to what I'm trying to tell you" style of exposition, and his relentless quest to find mathematical harmony in nature. Kepler spent more than a decade trying to show that the ratios between the Platonic solids explained not only the ratios between the orbits of the planets but also why there were six planets, no more and no less. He ultimately abandoned that idea in favor of his famous [laws of planetary motion](http://en.wikipedia.org../../Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion). But for quite a long time, he was convinced that the sheer good fit between things in pure mathematics ought to explain fundamental facts about planets.

And indeed most INTP reasoning boils down to, "These things fit together so well, there must be a single underlying cause, and that cause is precisely what binds them to fit together like that." Or in other words, *elegance* of fit, or harmony of parts—*internal* coherence—is what one ultimately appeals to to prove a theory. "Anything that makes this much sense must be true."

So perhaps even right-brain, external-reference-point-oriented forms of mental representation can lead a person to reason along something like the pattern of the ontological argument—pertaining not so much to existence as to structure and causation.

Many FPs (illustrating [introverted feeling](../../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-feeling)) explain their belief in a personal God as something that they see manifested in everything that they come across: a guiding hand ensuring that everything happens for a purpose. The sheer way that this explanation makes things make sense to them, in terms of [introverted feeling](../../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-feeling)), makes the truth of the explanation compelling.

### Against this hypothesis

There's a big difference between *conjecturing*, on the basis of a good fit between theory and data, that the theory is true (or even insisting that the good fit "proves" that the theory is true), and thinking that the theory alone is proof of its truth. Internal coherence is no doubt the guiding star by which one navigates in Ti and Fi reflection on one's experiences, and the nature of what counts as coherent derives from the nature of the representation (Ti or Fi). But the coherence must be found in experienced reality. The feeling is that the observed things in the concrete world suggest or prove to the mind that there is an underlying cause producing them.

What makes an ontological argument is the total observation- and reality-independence of the proof. Anselm states explicitly that this kind of proof is what he was seeking: "a single argument that needed nothing but itself alone for proof." In other words, a self-contained world of words that would prove something about the external world, *without* appeal to observation and data.

Doesn't reality-independence in all its forms, including out-and-out solipsism, reflect [Lenore](../../typologists/lenore-thomson)'s concept of [Introverted Perception](../../function-attitude/functions/perception), especially Ni, taken to an extreme, and no other [function-attitude](../fundamentals/function-attitude)? When we start using words without regard to any experience that they refer to, we are in the world of "left-brain imagination", not the right-brain world where words must refer to things and patterns found in experience or they seem meaningless (see [Truth-and-Language Exegesis](../../exegeses/truth-and-language-exegesis)).
