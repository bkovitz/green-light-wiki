The 1976 film directed by Martin Scorsese, starring Robert de Niro, Cybill Shepherd, Jodie Foster, Harvey Keitel, Albert Brooks.

[Roger Ebert's review](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-taxi-driver-1976) of *Taxi Driver.*

This is a movie about [inferior](../../main/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/inferior-function) extraversion.

The movie could almost be summarized in [Lenorean](../../main/typologists/lenore-thomson) terms: Travis Bickle lives in so completely introverted a world, he's lost all extraverted connection despite living in a bustling city. He ultimately draws attention to himself and creates a place for himself in the world by acting out instinctive dramas of combat and rescue that have almost nothing to do with the reality of his situation.

## Hypothesis: Travis Bickle, INTJ

Travis Bickle is the lead character, played by Robert de Niro.

Travis displays the amazing self-discipline and completely self-initiated motivation and vision typical of INTJs. Gripped by his visions of cleaning up the city and assassinating a politician, he runs his life in truly goal-directed, "executive judgement" [Te](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-thinking) style, getting his body into excellent shape, mastering weapons, carrying out plans and executing them with never a moment of self-doubt.

When he takes up guns, with all that Te follow-through, his rehearsals would seem to show inferior Se. He doesn't particularly want respect. He wants people's blood to chill with fear when he surprises them and makes his impact. He wants power—the power to respond instantly, crushingly, surprisingly, with overwhelming force.

The sign in his apartment, and his conversation with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), about "One of these days I'm going to get organiz-iz-ed" might even be a hint of Te as showing the kind of path that would bring his energy and discipline to something more constructive and more harmonious with the community around him.

He is surrounded by the dominant-Se world of prostitutes, crime, shows, lights, everything in the city trying to grab his attention.

[Lenore](../../main/typologists/lenore-thomson) would seem to make him an ITP, and his famous "Are you talking to me?" rehearsal in the mirror an illustration of inferior [Fe](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling)—reacting to perceived disrespect.

There are INTP gun nuts who think the world is being ruined by scum and filth and therefore requires some draconian changes, but a big difference between them and Travis Bickle is the complexity of their reasoning. The NTP gun nuts have complicated reasoning, based on all sorts of authorities, observations, precedents, facts, and so on, that "show" that people are justified in acting outside the law—because they are acting in accord with a higher law, one that is just as rigorous.

Travis Bickle doesn't really have any reasoning for anything he does or thinks. He directly perceives that the city is filled with scummy people, and that's all there is to it. He directly perceives that his whole life had been aimed directly at assassinating Jack Palantine, and that's all there is to it. This would seem to be the way of Ni: one's ideas are experienced as direct perception, not needing reasoning and not needing comfirmation from other people or connection with other people's ideas. What is "perceived" in this manner, though, is not directly observable things like shapes, colors, people, but something felt as penetrating beyond appearances—the true, underlying reality, the deeper meaning of what is going on.

Travis's mind only begins to acquire order and coherence when he seeks defined goals: his job as a taxi driver where he works "long hours" and focuses on the bottom line, his pursuit of mastery of guns, and his attempts to assassinate and rescue. All this would suggest secondary Te.

Also in contrast with NTPs, Travis does nothing tentatively. When he has a goal, he acts to achieve it, straight as an arrow. He does not play around. NTPs play around relentlessly, it being felt that play will yield unexpected insights and that *a priori* reasoning or goal-direction is inherently too narrow and uninformed a way to get yourself connected with the world.

The movie could perhaps be summarized as "Travis lives in an inarticulate, uninformed world of [introverted perception](../../main/function-attitude/functions/perception), is pained by his loneliness and lack of connection to others, doesn't really understand it, senses dimly that Te is a way forward, but mostly spends his time on Se ways to get noticed and make an impact—which are a disaster." We don't really see Ni in any clear way, Bickle is so introverted. We can only guess dominant Ni because inferior Se is so much in evidence.

### Against this hypothesis

Bickle is remarkably uncurious. He doesn't know or care anything about politics, and he ruins his date with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) because he's never learned anything about movies. You'd think an N would have the kind of wide-ranging curiosity to have learned about these things by age 26.

Where's [Fi](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-feeling)? In an off-balance INTJ who is neglecting an extraverted perspective, you would expect not a concern with fixing the world, but with keeping one's own soul pure—especially, by acts involving *refraining* from involvement in the outer world in ways designed to justify belief in one's goodness or superiority (e.g. refraining from eating animals, refraining from killing people).

See the ISTP hypothesis below. There, you don't need to infer the [dominant function](../../main/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/dominant-function) indirectly because of inferior behavior, the [dominant function](../../main/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/dominant-function) is continually in evidence in his willingness to break the law to serve a higher law.

#### Against against this hypothesis

Perhaps [tertiary](../../main/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/tertiary-function) Fi shows up in Bickle's view that the badness of people's surroundings stems from the innate weakness or rottenness of their souls. And what about his attempts at charity, going into the bad sections of town, as Lenore describes ISFPs, trying to rescue the few people that he perceives as good? The Jodie Foster character did nothing to *deserve* to be rescued; rather, Bickle thought that she deserved to be rescued only because of what she was.

## Hypothesis: Travis Bickle, ISTJ

Consonant with Bickle's lack of wide-ranging curiosity (suggesting S) is the fact that he takes on a "rescuer" role, acting out a primitive self-concept as the hero rescuing the girl from captors. He's oblivious to the fact that both the women he tries to rescue are pretty happy where they are.

### Against ISTJ

Bickle does not lament *details* being out of place. He doesn't care much at all about whether specific details are "right" or not. Concern that details be "right", regardless of how they relate to your personal business, simply because details matter for their own sake and you think a huge amount depends on them, would be such a hallmark of Si that it's hard to [type guess](../index) someone ISJ if they don't have that trait.

### An expansion of the hypothesis

[Introverted Sensation](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-sensation) would seem to fit the main way in which Travis Bickle perceives the world around him, particularly through the exaggerations of his apparent psychosis. Most of his complaints, while most definitely subjective impressions of PERCEPTIONS ( introverted perception), would most likely lend itself more towards sensation than intuition based on the ridgid, judgemental aspect of his loathing as opposed to varieties of open-ended intepretations of meaning. Afterall, [Introverted Sensation](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-sensation) seems to be the function which is responsible for dictating the stimuli which is regarded as important and valuable, and through the exaggeration of psychosis, potentially as being highly depended on and required. If Bickle was, for example, an INTJ, his thinking would most likely not have become as ridgid and uncompromising as it did. The approaches Bickle took towards solving the extreme disparity he felt between his Si defined comfort zones and the mis-alignment with the world, are clearly Te in nature; he develops a systematic, goal-oriented approach towards solving his internal problems by augmenting ( quite violently) externals, thereby aligning the world's textures with his own sensory preferences. There is another element that introduces itself of course which is very relevant to his motivations; that of Fi. As a tertiary function, Fi is not highly developed, but still apparently feeds his ridgid Si and ambitious Te with a veneer of personal values. This is expressed succinctly in his talk with Jodie Foster about his disapproval with her lifestyle, which also seems to utilize his second crow's nest function, Extraverted Feeling, to justify his beliefs. This justification could be seen in how he compares Foster's actions with what Girls are SUPPOSED to be doing at her age, in another words, a value-based rationale that calls upon societal norms. The passion to pursue this however seems to be fueled by the more personal feelings of Introverted feeling, and ultimately dominated by his broader obsession with his own needs of familiarity and comfort. Lastly, the presence of Extraverted Intuition as his [inferior function](../../main/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/inferior-function) is definitely supported by a lack of socially adaptive behavior, and theoretical pathways towards either A) taking a more enlightened approach to the nature of reality by constantly seeing new possibilities or B) saving himself from becoming embroiled in high-pressure, taxing situations by seeing other possible plans of action.

All in all, Travis Bickle, particularly from a Lenorean standpoint, seems like the quintessential ISTJ.

## Hypothesis: Travis Bickle, ISTP

Another take on Travis's inferior extraversion is the one Roger Ebert gives: that Bickle is essentially *lonely* and longs to make a connection with people. This is consonant with Lenore's take that the "You talkin' to me?" scene is inferior Fe.

Seeing himself as providing law and order to a world that has none would be very consonant with dominant Ti. In his mind, he is at work on justice, seeing to it that people get what's rightfully coming to them, the good people getting rescued and the bad people getting killed. His sense of justice does not relate to man-made laws (Te), but to something experienced as transcending culture, an inner attunement to how things ought to be. That view of justice might be the classic illustration of Lenore's conception of Ti, especially as it creates the self-image of ISTPs.

The same observations about an [Ni](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) self-experience of "direct perception" (i.e. no reasoning for his wild beliefs) would work here as tertiary Ni.

### Against ISTP

When he drives around watching the people of the city, he isn't thinking inferior-Fe thoughts like, "Look at those people, all affectionate and loving with each other, isn't that disgusting?" or "Look at those people, they've all got somebody who cares for them, but no one cares for me, the unappreciative bastids!" It's more like, "Look at those people and the viscerally disgusting reaction they produce! Inferior beings! Let the rain wash them away!"

He practices his weapons mostly for pride and to make himself a dangerous force on Earth, not for the joy of play. He doesn't seem to love his weapons for the sake of the artistic or aesthetic rightness of them.

When the pimp (Harvey Keitel, "Sport") tries to joke with Bickle, Bickle is stiff and doesn't even seem to get the jokes. Bickle is stunningly literal-minded, even as he thinks of himself as possessing deep insight, just like a certain "wooden" sort of INTJ.

Bickle dresses like a "square". So square that the pimp thinks he's a cop when they first meet. Bickle has no sense of shock value, entertainingness, grand gestures, or the joy of drawing attention to oneself for fun. Hardly an SP mentality.

How would [Se](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-sensation) help this guy?

Against [Introverted Thinking](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-thinking) (for [Extraverted Sensation](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-sensation)): Jung: The [Extraverted Thinking](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-thinking) function devolves (somewhat) to est ergo est. The introverted thinking function devolves to cogito ergo cogito. For the most part, certain types are assigned to TiS because people don't recognize the real non-N subtype(s) of introverted thinking. Se tends to destroy that which they find hypocritical (or that which threatens them, or that which is denied them). A significant amount of descriptions of TiS deal with the less social variants of Se or Ne (Bruce Lee - Ne).

TiS/F goes to problem solving. Think Stephen Hawking (maybe???), Isaac Asimov, Bobby Fisher, Dilbert.

Gun nuts are almost always a counterphobic Fi/6 variant (or related). Focused way too much on the attitudes and possible attitudes of the people around them than internal arrangement of non-people oriented ideas (problem-solution/systematic-pattern apperception - these aren't fully mutually exclusive — people may be an ancillary phenomena in these ideas, but they aren't primary (except in psychology/sociology, obviously)).

The intuitive subtype of Ti will write books like "Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World", Roger Zelazny.

Tis so seriously dislike being interrupted that it is very rare we'd attempt to draw notice except with our ideas (the kind as stated above).

Caveat: I haven't seen the movie, but am reasoning on various things I've read.

Retracted some things, what's left I'm as certain as I possibly can be about it.
