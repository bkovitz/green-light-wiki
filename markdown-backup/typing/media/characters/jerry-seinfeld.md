## Hypothesis: ENTP

How about Jerry ENTP, [George Costanza](https://web.archive.org/web/20101218131646/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/George_Costanza) INTP, Kramer ESFP, Elaine ESFJ/ESTJ? Jerry seems too comfortable in too many ways to be INTJ, and too interactive and contemplative and observant to be ISTP. Plus ENTPs are the only NT function combination to use Extraverted Feeling in any tangible way, which it seems to me that Jerry does to get out of his messes. He's a charmer. I've yet to meet an INTJ or ISTP who "charms" much, or at least not very well.

And not all INTPs are smart *per se,* but one thing George does seem to be is excessively lacking in [Extraverted Feeling](../../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling), while meeting his immediate needs in an inventive kind of way. If you do a Sherlockian method, and eliminate the impossible, whatever is left, however improbable, must be the truth. He lives with his parents, his fake career is in architecture, when he broke out of his tertiary-controlled patterns he got everything he wanted (for one episode), and he justifies eating garbage out of the trash—what else is there?

Kramer and Elaine are self-explanatory, although they may have mildly morphed Elaine from an ESFJ into an ESTJ over time.

Kinda like the Beatles, they were great because they covered all of the function bases, until the last couple seasons when Elaine got really harsh.

## Hypothesis: ISTJ

As opposed to ISTPs (e.g. Carrot Top, John Stewart), he doesn't modify his humor and actions directly based on audience feedback, he checks to see whether the audience agrees with him.
