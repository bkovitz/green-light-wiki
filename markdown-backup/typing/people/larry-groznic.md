## Hypothesis: INTP

Spends a long time trying to lay a guilt trip on his friend and be excused for not showing up at a wedding, all of which seems unequivocally [Fe](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling). But the language in which he expresses all this and makes his case is that of faithfulness to The Prisoner, a cause that he sees as trumping conventional ways of expressing relationship and even calling for redefining them, no matter what the cost in friendship. As I understand Lenore, that's the classic Ji pattern. He describes The Prisoner not as a personal taste or an expression of his uniqueness or special calling, which I would understand as [Fi](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-feeling), but as something impersonal. His argument is that The Prisoner merits this appreciation and dedication because of its objectively high quality: its faithfulness to the timeless nature of the things that it's about, its successful and extraordinarily full realization of what it is. Neil is supposed to respect The Prisoner, not Larry Groznic; any respect for Larry Groznic would derive from Larry's appreciation of The Prisoner and his endless demonstrations of loyalty to it.

So, in [Lenore](../../main/typologists/lenore-thomson) terms, I understand this as an extreme [dominant](../../main/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/dominant-function)-[Ti](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-thinking) perspective demanding that cultural [Fe](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling) standards be redefined to fit it, and announcing willingness to pay the price in lost relationship if others don't play along.

As for N and S, I have a harder time explicitly pointing these out, but the article also seems to well illustrate tertiary Si, at least in my current vague understanding of it. Obviously, there are the gobs of facts memorized and loved, but what I am thinking of is better described as foot-dragging: a perversely ISFJ-like sense that if we don't hold fast to our Prisoner-inspired traditions, something truly precious will be lost, undermining the basis of Larry's friendship with Neil and the other Prisoner fans.
