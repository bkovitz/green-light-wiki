## Marshall Rosenberg as...

## Nonviolent Communication as Introverted Feeling

NVC, at its core, is about understanding _why_ people do the things that they do and having empathy for their feelings, motivations, and needs--and to understand these same things within yourself. [Familiar isn't it?](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-feeling)

Rosenberg notes that when expressions of needs are unintuitive or not transparent, it is important to try to understand what is beneath the surface.

For example, a mother grieving her son may angrily lash out at her coworkers. It is easy to assume that she is a very nasty person and to express anger at her in return. From a NVC perspective, it is encouraged to view her actions with empathy and to avoid judgement and reacting negatively in kind. Beneath the screaming is a mother telling the world: "I feel a great sorrow in my heart after my son's death. I don't know how to cope with it effectively at work."

You wouldn't want to hurt a mother expressing a deep pain like thatâ€”but it's difficult when she isn't saying that _directly_ and engaging in unpleasant behaviour. What Rosenberg urges us to do, then, is to look beyond the actions of a person (within reason) and respond to the underlying needs instead.

He also advises people to express their needs in their truest forms. Instead of saying "Fine! You never cared about me at all!", it would be better to say "I feel scared and sad because I think you don't care about me."

When we express our desires as they are, it shines a light to what we _truly_ feel for the other party to see: "Ouch, I hurt, I want, I need. Please help me." From there, we can heal together and avoid the pitfalls of defensiveness and misreading others.

## In contrast to Transactional Analysis

[Eric Berne](./eric-berne)'s Transactional Analysis is an [Fe](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling) perspective on miscommunication.

Where Rosenberg views self-defeating behaviours as acting on destructive instincts to meet their needs, Berne views them as destructive games in which people corral others into roles to meet their needs. They are describing similar scenarios with Fi vs. Fe framing: A person demonstrating what they want (Fi) and playing games to get it out of another (Fe).

Fittingly, Berne's _Games People Play_ suggests Fe solutions (nudge the other person into a different role that will be better for you both and view games as bids to meet needs) and _Nonviolent Communication_ suggests Fi solutions (describe what you want sincerely and view others expressing their needs).
