A difference between the [Lenore Thomson](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson) and [David Keirsey](/wiki/main/typologists/david-keirsey) or [Myers-Briggs](/wiki/main/typologists/myers-briggs) approaches to "typing" someone is that in the latter, you match people against profiles, but in the former, you explain their behavior and life situation as the result of an interplay of opposing [function-attitude](/wiki/main/fundamentals/function-attitude).

From the [Lenore Thomson](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson) perspective, a type guess is not an attempt to match someone to a profile, but a guess about how they're mentally representing their world and orienting themselves to it.

Before reading any of these, be sure to read [Type Guesses and the Definition Problem](/wiki/typing/type-guesses-and-the-definition-problem).

## Making a type guess

When you make a type guess on this wiki, please do two things in addition to stating a four-letter code:

- Point out some interesting concrete detail about the person that's relevant to your guess. Better yet, point out lots of interesting concrete details
- If it's not obvious, give some explanation, brief or long, of why those details relate to Lenore's concepts, or at to least some particular interpretation of them.

This will give a reader (and yourself) much more food for thought than just an unexplained four-letter code.

Remember that our goal here is not to definitively attach a four-letter code to a person, it's to shed light on Lenore's ideas. The best type guesses are those that use the person to illustrate the ideas, rather than merely sort the person into a certain category (like the [MBTI](/wiki/main/typologists/myers-briggs)). [Eric Berne](/wiki/typing/people/eric-berne) and [George Costanza](/wiki/typing/media/characters/george-costanza) are the kind of type guesses we want: they might be wrong, but they are actually more [Lenore](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson) [exegesis](/wiki/main/fundamentals/exegesis) than argumentation that a certain four-letter code is correct. They first and foremost offer proposals of ideas about what Lenore is talking about, merely using the person to that end.

Note: the host ([Ben Kovitz](https://web.archive.org/web/20110116072807/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Ben_Kovitz)) will delete pages that contain just an unexplained type guess. (See also [First-person Declarations](/wiki/main/far-flung-explorations/first-person-declarations).)
