[Lenore Thomson](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson) is the author of [Personality Type: An Owner's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Type-Practical-Understanding-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00KLFBMKG), a book that takes the [Myers-Briggs](/wiki/main/typologists/myers-briggs) personality type system back to its roots in [Jungian](/wiki/main/typologists/carl-jung) psychology. Or perhaps redefines [Myers-Briggs](/wiki/main/typologists/myers-briggs) as a vocabulary for analyzing politics and public discourse. We don't really know. On this web site, we try to figure out what she's talking about. You're invited to help (see below).

### About this web site

[Lenore Thomson](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson)'s book is simply written, filled with examples and analogies from popular TV shows like Star Trek and The X Files. Even so, it can be maddeningly difficult to understand. She touches on a wide range of deep and broad topics from ancient philosophy to Sufism to contemporary pop culture. She seems to have something very definite in mind by her many [terms with nonobvious meanings](/wiki/main/our-difficulties/terms-with-nonobvious-meanings). She never really quite defines them, though, and it's difficult to pin down her meaning.

[Lenore](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson) is the first popular author to go into depth about what the [function attitudes](/wiki/main/fundamentals/function-attitude) are, and she turns [Myers-Briggs](/wiki/main/typologists/myers-briggs) from a system of personality classification to a path of personal growth, something like the [Enneagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main/Enneagram_of_Personality). Her book might also be a vocabulary of mental [heuristics](https://web.archive.org/web/20071215002147/http://greenlightwiki.com/heuristic), a unified view of many conflicting strands of philosophic thought (perhaps what [Carl Jung](/wiki/main/typologists/carl-jung) intended), and an analysis of how and why people's rhetorical expectations sometimes clash. We don't really know quite what to make of her book—hence this web site.

This wiki is a place where we explore what [Lenore Thomson](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson) is talking about by trying to put it into our own words—[exegesis](/wiki/main/fundamentals/exegesis). The text on this wiki is written by anyone who cares to post, and edited and rewritten by anyone who cares to edit and rewrite. We welcome all [Lenore](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson)-related ideas: what's posted here is not necessarily correct, it's not checked or approved by [Lenore Thomson](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson), and it's not necessarily any clearer than [Lenore](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson)'s original writing. If you find what looks like an internal contradiction here, it probably is. We make no attempt to be consistent; we're looking for many different angles on [Lenore](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson)'s stuff. The only [Lenore](/wiki/main/typologists/lenore-thomson)-related topic we're not interested in is judgements of whether her ideas are right or wrong. We leave that to the reader.
