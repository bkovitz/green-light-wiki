## What this wiki is about

This wiki is for understanding [Lenore Thomson](../typologists/lenore-thomson)'s ideas about [psychological type](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014043137/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/psychological_type), mostly as described in her book [Personality Type: An Owner's Manual](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0877739870/ref=ase_greenlightwik-20), and partly as she's talked about them on various Internet discussion lists.

By [exegesis](../fundamentals/exegesis), we do not simply mean "What did Lenore mean?" but rather "What is she talking about?" We don't aim to nail down precisely what is or was in Lenore's head. Rather, we aim to see for ourselves some of the same things that she is seeing and describing. Naturally, each person will see such things in his or her own way.

The purpose of this wiki is not to settle on any definite interpretation of Lenore's writing, but to learn whatever we happen to learn by trying to articulate Lenore's ideas in our own words and through our own observations, and by watching other people's attempts to do the same. It's inspired by Lance Fletcher's concept of [Slow Reading](https://www.chrisjohnsphd.net/uploads/5/0/2/0/50201359/slow_reading_long.pdf).

In accord with wiki tradition, when people propose opposing ideas, the wiki renders no verdict. Rather than attempting to have the wiki's text be an official statement of the settled truth of a matter, we encourage you to post all the competing ideas as clearly and persuasively as possible.

_Even if an interpretation turns out to be clearly wrong,_ we still want it on this wiki. This wiki is a record of people's thoughts as they try to make sense of Lenore's writing: the surprising insights, the dead ends, the great ideas, the dumb ideas, everything. Nothing on this wiki is an official statement of what [Lenore Thomson](../typologists/lenore-thomson) meant by anything she ever said.

While we eagerly welcome nearly any contribution of any Lenore-related ideas, we're not interested in judgements of Lenore's ideas, whether positive or negative. You're invited to explore and articulate the ideas, and leave judgement to the reader.

## About the Logo

If you're curious about the logo for _The Lenore Thomson Exegesis Wiki_, it's a redrawn figure from the Rider-Waite Tarot deck. For a hint about why that seemed an appropriate choice, see [Tea Leaves and Tarot Cards](../far-flung-explorations/tea-leaves-and-tarot-cards).
