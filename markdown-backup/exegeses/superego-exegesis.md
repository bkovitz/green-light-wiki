## A Freudian exegesis

### Id, Ego, Superego

Fe and Te are superego functions.

Se and Ne are ego functions.

If you truly do not have a sense of self as distinct, you truly do not have an ego. If a [function-attitude](../fundamentals/function-attitude) as a dominant does not have a sense of self as unique (and thus uniquely important), that [function-attitude](../fundamentals/function-attitude) is not an ego-attitude. (That is, if your dominant function is not an ego-function, you're going to have to hit another function for a sense of ego. â€” that is, [Lenore](../typologists/lenore-thomson) to experiment with their ability to stay up late and play hard, ETJs[^2] hitting their tertiary as a means to just quit regardless of the consequences, etc....)

When functioning as a dominant, a superego function (that is, [Extraverted Feeling](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling)) will not be oriented by the self.

### Another hypothesis

The [Secondary Function](../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/secondary-function) is the means by which a person orients himself to the superego. It follows that the [Tertiary Function](../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/tertiary-function) is the means by which a person orients himself to the id, while the actual contents of the id (unconscious) are accessed via the [Inferior Function](../function-attitude/cognitive-stack/inferior-function).

[^1]: Collective term for types who use [Extraverted Feeling](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling) (Fe) as their [Dominant Function](../dominant-function) attitude.

[^2]: Collective term for types who use [Extraverted Thinking](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-thinking) (Te) as their [Dominant Function](../dominant-function) attitude.
