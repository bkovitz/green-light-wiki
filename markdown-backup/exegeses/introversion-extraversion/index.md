Exegeses on what Lenore Thomson might mean by introversion and extraversion, both as attitudes that people can take and as personality types.

## Summary

Extraversion is an attitude oriented outwardly, towards the external and [Objective](../../our-difficulties/terms-with-nonobvious-meanings#objective-and-subjective). Introversion is an attitude oriented inwards, towards the self and its [Subjective](../../our-difficulties/terms-with-nonobvious-meanings#objective-and-subjective) ideals.

There are a few other patterns common to E vs. I as well. Extraversion prefers breadth, introversion prefers depth. Extraversion prefers deduction, introversion prefers induction. Extraversion is collective, introversion is individualist.

## Exegeses

### [Cocooning-vs.-Conforming Exegesis](./cocooning-vs-conforming-exegesis)

| Introversion                                                                                                            | Extraversion                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Building and occupying a "cocoon", a set-up where you are in control and where the environment is highly adapted to you | Conforming yourself to reality as it exists right now: to shape yourself to fit the reality |

### [Game-board Exegesis](./game-board-exegesis)

"The game" in this [exegesis](../../fundamentals/exegesis) refers to an external standard or framework (e.g. success, attractiveness, ethics, popularity, etc.).

| Introversion                                                                                                                                          | Extraversion                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Explore ideas and pursue goals without necessarily relating them to the game board                                                                    | What matters to you--what you define as being of interest to you and meriting your attention--is the game                                                           |
| The game board stimulates you to explore or experience the world of what can be potentially explored or experienced. This is the world of archetypes. | The game offers things to gain, and you attempt to gain them. If something doesn't register on the game board, where everyone can see it, it doesn't seem relevant. |

### [Negotiation Exegesis](./negotiation-exegesis)

| Introversion                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Extraversion                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What is good is good, and that's why you do it. Negotiation has nothing to do with it.                                                                                                                             | Everything that someone does as an attempt to negotiate with others                             |
| Interacts by first asking permission to enter another person's space. Views each person as trying to understand and practice the good in his own way, and this process is not something to interfere with lightly. | Interact by putting something on the table for others to react to, whether they like it or not. |

### [Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis](./saints-and-politicians-exegesis)

| Introversion                                                                                        | Extraversion                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| See things from a timeless perspective that enables you to criticize the social arena and its rules | The social arena you are in is a given; you try to figure out a way to fit into it                                                                                                                                  |
| Willing to challenge the social arena even when it comes with a steep social price                  | You can't judge the rules of the social arena; you are _in_ the social arena, and there are no thoughts to think except how to get around within the social arena, ways to do well in socially recognized ways, etc |

To put all this another way, extraversion makes you a politician while introversion makes you a saint.
