:::info[Function, attitude, or function-attitude?]

[Lenore](../typologists/lenore-thomson) often refers to function-attitudes just as "**functions**", which goes back to [Jung](../typologists/carl-jung). On this wiki, we lean toward the more intuitively clear word "**attitudes**".

:::

A _function-attitude_ is a [Jungian](../typologists/carl-jung) function used in an extraverted or introverted attitude. Each type uses a combination of the four functions in a preferred order. Summaries of the function-attitudes are available at [Philosophical Exegesis](../exegeses/philosophical-exegesis).

## Functions

In [Lenore](../typologists/lenore-thomson)'s system, there are four functions:

- [Sensation](../function-attitude/functions/sensation)
- [Intuition](../function-attitude/functions/intuition)
- [Thinking](../function-attitude/functions/thinking)
- [Feeling](../function-attitude/functions/feeling)

These are commonly grouped into **[Perception](../function-attitude/functions/perception)** (Sensation and Intuition) and **[Judgement](../function-attitude/functions/judgement)** (Thinking and Feeling) within [Jungian](../typologists/carl-jung) typology. **Irrational** and **rational** are used respectively as well, [albeit differently than common utilisation](./our-difficulties/terms-with-nonobvious-meanings).

| Perception/Irrational | Judgment/Rational |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Sensation             | Thinking          |
| Intuition             | Feeling           |

See [Introversion-Extraversion Exegeses](../exegeses/introversion-extraversion), in particular [Truth-and-Language Exegesis](../exegeses/truth-and-language-exegesis) for more information on why this may be.

## Attitudes

An attitude is a direction (introverted or extraverted) a function can have.

Some hypotheses on what introverted and extraverted might mean:

- [Orienting](../sign-interpretation/orienting)
- [Introversion-Extraversion Exegeses](../exegeses/introversion-extraversion)
  - [Truth-and-Language Exegesis](../exegeses/truth-and-language-exegesis)
  - [Cocooning-vs.-Conforming Exegesis](../exegeses/introversion-extraversion/cocooning-vs-conforming-exegesis)
  - [Game-Board Exegesis](../exegeses/introversion-extraversion/game-board-exegesis)
  - [Negotiation Exegesis](../exegeses/introversion-extraversion/negotiation-exegesis)
  - [Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis](../exegeses/introversion-extraversion/saints-and-politicians-exegesis)
  - [Place-Your-Stakes Exegesis](../exegeses/introversion-extraversion/place-your-stakes-exegesis)
- [Forward-Direction Exegesis](../exegeses/forward-direction-exegesis)
- [Shallowness](../far-flung-explorations/shallowness)

### Introversion

> p. 131 "Introverted cultures, such as the ones that exist in some of the asian countries, generally provide a kind of ritualized Extraverted vocabulary, whose use conveys the proper social attitude without compromising individual privacy."

_There is a very small chance that my country is an Introverted society, despite being a western society. How do I know? —Michelini_

_I think there have been psychological surveys of populations (meaning, freshman psych 101 college students) in different countries measuring introversion and extraversion. In general, an "introverted society" will have a majority introverted population, and an "extraverted society" will have a majority extraverted population. You could check what psych research has been done in your country. —Anonymous_

### Extraversion

> W.H Auden's poem [The Unknown Citizen](https://poets.org/poem/unknown-citizen) describes someone's life completely in extraverted terms.

See also [Negotiation Basics](../exegeses/introversion-extraversion/negotiation-exegesis#Negotiation_Basics) for another angle on exploring extraversion.

## Function-attitudes

These four functions are then split into introverted and extraverted functions according to how one [orients](../sign-interpretation/orienting) themselves.

| Extraverted                                                                        | Introverted                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Extraverted Sensation (Se)](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-sensation) | [Introverted Sensation (Si)](../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-sensation) |
| [Extraverted Intuition (Ne)](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-intuition) | [Introverted Intuition (Ni)](../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-intuition) |
| [Extraverted Thinking (Te)](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-thinking)   | [Introverted Thinking (Ti)](../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-thinking)   |
| [Extraverted Feeling (Fe)](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling)     | [Introverted Feeling (Fi)](../function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-feeling)     |

Exactly what a function-attitude _is_ is the main part of the [Definition Problem](../our-difficulties/definition-problem). See also [Genus Problem](../our-difficulties/genus-problem).

## [Jung](../typologists/carl-jung)'s choice of terminology

_Q._ Why did [Jung](../typologists/carl-jung) choose the term "function"?

_A._ Perhaps to get psychology to sound like physics or mathematics.

_...any other answers?_

_A._ [Jung](../typologists/carl-jung), _Psychological Types_, p.273: He borrow terms coined by _Otto Gross_. The "primary function" and the "secondary function".

_A._ He probably called it a function because it is a function! A function is an action performed by something, in this case a brain! It makes perfect sense.

A. Random House definition of function: 
1. the kind of action or activity proper to any person or thing 
2. the purpose for which something is designed or exists. 
As an INFJ, it makes perfect sense to me. Your function is what serves your purpose, it is what's proper to yourself. If you want more of where this came from, [check this out](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014000354/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/check_this_out)
