Fi: Until I _understand_ it in terms of empathy and how it relates to a living need that I might have, I don't see how I can relate to it.

Fe: Until I can see where this fits into my network of tribal bonds and obligations, I don't see how I can relate to it. How can I tell if I'm for it or against it until I know how other people feel about it?

Ti: Until I _understand_ the causal principle at work, in terms of mathematical relationships that necessitate it behaving the way it does, I don't see how I can relate to it. It would all be arbitrary, and any response I would make would be arbitrary.

Te: Until I can see how you would make an empirical test for what you're saying, I don't see how I can relate to it. Without a defined empirical test, all conclusions are subjective.

Si: Until I can find it on a map that I can carry around complete within myself, providing a set of things to look for and meanings that they correspond to, I don't see how I can relate to it.

Se: Until it triggers a gut-level response in me, I don't see how I can relate to it; and I don't see how I could relate to it in any way but with whatever gut-level response it triggers in me.

Ni: Until I can separate myself from its built-in interpretations and see it from the outside, in terms of a framework that is independent of everything about it, I refuse to relate to it. [You can't make me look](../far-flung-explorations/rhetoric/you-cant-make-me-look)â€”at least, not your way.

Ne: If I can't broaden the context to see how it relates to something else and thereby gains a new meaning, then I refuse to relate to it. I'll just go do something else and then we'll see how important your little thing is.
