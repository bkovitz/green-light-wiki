## Quasi-defining statements

> p. 42: "When we use [[Thinking]] in an Introverted way, we get a mental image of the logical relationships in an entire system. For example, if we're crocheting an initial into a sweater, we're likely to draw a picture rather than work out the logical relationships analytically."
>
> p. 342: "Introverted Thinking is a right-brain form of judgement that makes us aware of a situation's many variables. When we use it, we recognize our power, as individuals, to exploit some variables at the expense of others."
>
> p. 343: "This kind of awareness is not only impersonal: it's graphic, immediate, and wholistic. It prompts no predetermined categories of good and bad. Variables that have unusual or perverse potential are accorded the same consideration as variables that assure a socially appropriate outcome."
>
> p. 287: "As a right-brain function, Introverted Thinking is not conceptual and linear \[_contra_ [[Extraverted Thinking]]]. It's body-based and wholistic. It operates by way of visual, tactile, or spatial cues, inclining us to reason experientially rather than analytically."
>
> p. 288: "The right brain, with its all-at-once approach to life, doesn't require exact predictability before it takes action. Its decisions are based on probabilities, and it leaves room for the random and the unexpected."
>
> p. 290: "These perceptions aren't peripheral. They're crucial to our intended effect. And they aren't reflexive. They're _unspecified_. As we're selecting and responding to them, we're not defining them and telling ourselves about them in a left-brain way."

As a [[Dominant Function]]:

> p. 292: "Introverted Thinkers understand reality _only_ in terms of their ability to 'converse' with it, to take part in its 'becoming'."

As a [[Secondary Function]]:

> p. 210: "Unlike [[Extraverted Thinking]], which is conceptual and generalized, [[Introverted Thinking]] motivates strategic action in a specific situation. When ENTPs use it, they don't start with abstract rules and apply them, step by step, to bring about a goal. They recognize themselves as part of an ongoing process, and they keep adjusting their behaviors in terms of the whole picture."
>
> p. 210: "When combined with [[Extraverted Intuition]], [[Introverted Thinking]] can be highly cerebral, and it usually involves a complex imaginal pattern of relationships. For example, an ENTP might enjoy playing chess, because such types can usually anticipate the results of many potential combinations of moves. An ENTP salesperson might pull together a host of small details and recognize in one mental image how a customer is likely to respond to a product. An ENTP cultural historian might see how a seemingly insignificant detail in a popular movie actually defines the underlying ethos of a culture."

## Proposed Definitions

### Definition #1: Orientation to underlying cause

**Introverted Thinking** (Ti) is the attitude that beneath the complexity of what is manifest (apparent, observed, experienced) there is an underlying unity: a source or essence that emerges and takes form in different ways depending on circumstances. What is manifest is seen as a manifestation _of_ something. From a Ti standpoint, the way to respond to things is in a way that is faithful to that underlying cause or source and helps it emerge fully and complete, without interference from any notion of self. The way to understand that underlying essence is to learn to simultaneously see many relationships within what is manifest, to see every element in relation to every other element, the relationships being the "signature" of the underlying unity. This can only be experienced directly, not second-hand.

### Definition #2: Orientation by "the groove"

**Introverted thinking** is a form of mental representation in which every input, every variable, every aspect of things is considered simultaneously and holistically to perceive causal, mathematical, and aesthetic order. What you know by Ti, you know with your hands, your eyes, your muscles, even a tingling sensation "downstairs" because you sense that everything fits. Every variable is fair game to vary, every combination of variables worthy of consideration; the only ultimate arbiter is how well the parts form a unified whole rather than a jumble.

[[Orienting]] by Ti, you track causal harmony: you are part of the system, you do your part to fit in with that overall way that things make sense and harmonize. You get into "the flow" or "the zone". You need a gestalt sense of order to know what to do—a sense that you feel in your body, in your mind, in everything at once. "I get it." Without that, you are lost.

_For example:_ You hear a Brahms piece that you've never heard before, and you're sure it's Brahms. How can you tell? You can't name a criterion, like the pitch of the notes, the number of notes, or some simply measurable criterion like that (see [[extraverted thinking]]). You know "all at once" because of the way in which the notes all relate to each other. You sense the overall pattern as an indivisible gestalt way in which the music makes sense.

_For example:_ You are composing a piece of music, and you sense that something "doesn't fit". A dominant seventh chord here just doesn't fit the style of the piece. You take it out and replace it with a peculiar series of ambiguous chords, bridging two sections of the piece in a way that leads to but doesn't give away what is to come. Ahh, now _that's_ right. That's what the piece really wanted. It's not what "you" wanted, it's what the emerging causal harmony of the music wanted. "Your" only job is to create faithfully to that emerging harmony—to follow the groove.

What is that groove? What distinguishes the harmonious whole from the jumble, or the almost-whole? This cannot be said, it can only be pointed to. It cannot be defined in advance of knowing it. It cannot be defined separately from the physical material that it potentially exists within. You can "say" it only by directing someone's attention to the parts and how they fit together. You acquire terms of discourse—a vocabulary of things to say—only through "conversation" with the material itself: interacting with it, letting it take shape. Once you've found the groove, you can explore it endlessly—the infinity of ways in which the underlying Idea of the Whole necessitates the arrangement of the parts, the infinity of different ways that the same Idea can be realized in different parts and different situations, and what that Idea is.

In contrast to the "linear thinking" necessitated by [[extraverted thinking]]'s representation in terms of verbally defined criteria, Ti takes in everything at once and converts it into a "way in which the whole fits together." You can't stop and explain each step as you go; there are no steps, only flow, only finding the groove and going with it.

In contrast to other attitudes, especially left-brain and [[Feeling]] attitudes, Ti does not lead you to experience a sense of self. There is no "you" who is separate from the process in which the material takes on the form that is natural to it. Whether people find the way the parts want to arrange themselves into a harmonious whole offensive, whether you find it pleasant or painful, whether you personally like it or not—you see these as distractions. Your job is to get yourself in harmony with it. The Idea of the whole must become real, and it must be necessitated by the nature of the parts. What "you" create must already be there, as form latent within the material, already yearning to exist. You bring no notion of self to your work except perhaps that of midwife to Nature.

## High-bandwidth understanding

[[Introverted Thinking]] leads you to relate whatever you are doing to some larger principles that you have identified. Hence, Ti is like having some kind of book in your head, which describes the inner workings of things. When interacting with reality, you are constantly writing and re-writing your book. To deal with anything, you have to be able to understand in terms of the observations in your book. Whenever you are dealing with any new system, you start writing a new chapter on it in order to attain complete understanding of it.

This approach may seem very cumbersome from an extraverted standpoint. You don't really need to understand how a bicycle works in order to ride one. You don't have to actually understand a subject in school if you simply cram and memorize. You don't have to understand computers to check your email. Yet Ti leads you to desire complete understanding of whatever you are doing, instead of looking up the correct procedure, or asking your friends for help, or kicking it when it's not working. With Ti, you don't simply try to understand a system well enough to manipulate it. You try to become such an expert on how it works that you could write a book about it if you had to, even if your expertise is unusable or useless to everybody (sometimes even to yourself).

Hence, Ti is a kind of _high-bandwidth_ understanding, because it leads you to try to understand the entire causal, aesthetic, or logical mechanism of any system of interest. This kind of understanding takes much more time and effort to develop, but it is more flexible once attained, because it allows you to deal with aspects of reality that cannot be described through social norms or sets of discrete procedures.

## True knowledge comes through the fingers

In a sense that everyone understands, true knowledge comes through the fingers, not through the ears or the eyes.

To illustrate what we mean by that, consider what happens when someone tells you how to do something moderately complicated with a certain computer program (say, MS-Word or Excel). They tell you how to work it, but that day you don't operate it yourself (maybe they were telling you over the phone when you weren't at a computer). When you finally try it yourself the next day, you can't get anything to work. All sorts of crucial details are missing from your memory. Or perhaps you remember everything perfectly, but they forgot to tell you something crucial. Now consider what happens when someone sits down in front of you and demonstrates how to operate the program. They run through the whole thing and explain as they go. The next day, you try it yourself for the first time. And barely anything works, again because crucial details are missing. And now consider what happens when they show you how to work the program by having _you_ sit down at the computer. You type as they tell you what to do and point things out on the screen. Every time they forget a detail, you catch it immediately, and they supply the missing info. Every time you run into something you don't understand, you just ask them right away, or they tell you without your asking because it's obvious what you need to be shown. When you work the program again the next day, you're not a pro yet, but you can actually do stuff.

What's relevant here is not the sense of touch, but whether you are actively engaged with the tool. When you _interact_ with the tool using your very own body, the reality of the tool becomes known to you in a different way than when someone tells you or shows you how to use the tool. You understand in a right-brain way rather than a left-brain way. The reality of the tool is guaranteed to have shown itself, because you had a concrete experience with the tool, not just a verbal or symbolic representation of it. The causal relationships of the tool get burned into your brain in a way that transcends words. You could try to translate your understanding into a linear stream of words, but you would indeed be translating: the actual knowledge that you have is not linear and not words. It's an "all at once" thing, and it seems that the knowledge resides in your hand.

Or in other words, you have come to understand the tool in the Ti way.

## Goals

Perhaps the notion of a goal explains why Lenore calls Ti [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|Subjective]]:

> p. 288: "We have to recognize, in the midst of action, which variables are best taken into account and which are irrelevant to our goal."
>
> p. 290: "When we're [[Thinking]] in an Introverted way, we're coordinating our behaviors with the variables in a situation related to our intended effect. This is a matter of logic, limitation, and goal orientation—all the things we associate with a rational approach to life."
>
> p. 287: "[Subjective](../../our-difficulties/terms-with-nonobvious-meanings) logic—a way to coordinate our behaviors logically with immediate sensory data: the position of the ball, the skill of the batter coming up, the distance we can probably slide, the actions of the other players."
>
> p. 287: "When we use (Introverted Thinking), we're not structuring experience before it actually exists. We're engaged by conditions here and now, and we're adjusting to them in light of their impact on our goal."

Perhaps in these passages Lenore is describing Ti as something other than a [[Dominant Function]]. My own experience is not one of seeking goals. Seeking a goal usually seems to me unpleasant, going against the grain of things. My own experience, and I think what most ITPs report, is more an attempt to coax something out, to give form to some idea that I won't fully understand until it's been given form. A goal known in advance of this process would interfere with the process; it would corrupt the idea so that what emerges wouldn't be pure.

—[Ben Kovitz](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022326/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Ben_Kovitz)

_EXTPs do not seek_ goals _either, not in the TJ sense. I recognise_ opportunitie&#x73;_. My goal then is to exploit them, but I often meander because of what I discover along the way (or because of sheer laziness). I have an idea of what I want, but that idea is very flexible, and I go where emerging discoveries and circumstances take me._

_I'd correct the p. 287 quote to say that by adjusting ourselves to the conditions in the here and now, we also adjust our goals._

Thank you, Michelle! Maybe you'll enjoy the new definition I just added to [[Extraverted Intuition]]. —[Ben Kovitz](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022326/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Ben_Kovitz)

## [[Semiotically Disoriented]] in dominant-Ti style

> p. 293: "Unless the man had direct involvement in the unfolding process and could exert some effect on its logical outcome, he didn't know how to relate to it."

## As a Language of [[Ego Orientation]]

### As a [[Dominant Function]]

Ti leads ITPs to follow a quest of figuring out the workings of the world firsthand. ITPs want the world to make sense. If they lack the power to command nature to follow its own harmony and rules, at least they can make sure that their actions make sense (at least to themselves). Whether their actions please anyone else, or follow social custom is simply irrelevant. Social rules usually appear arbitrary and meaningless to ITPs, because the goal of those rules is to meet human needs, not to follow the principles of how the ITP thinks the world _should_ work. For INTPs, the world is a set of systems that are governed by certain underlying rules and principles (physics is an example of such a system). INTPs seek to grasp an inductive understanding of the system as a whole though firsthand observation. For an INTP, humans (even oneself) are simply represented as another set of variables in the system. ISTPs... _need more..._\
....allows them to visualize potential opportunites (forethought, prediction)

### As a [[Secondary Function]]

Ti helps ETPs find some order and continuity in their quests for sensory or mental stimulus. Ti also helps them figure out how to get whatever Se or Ne impels them to want. _need more..._

### As a [[Tertiary Function]]

Ti leads IFJs to.... ?

> ...."advise others on the wisdom of their choices" (edited from [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]], p.231 on INFJs.)

vis a vis Ti as a primary attribute. Also, tertiary Ti leads to an important emphasis on personal experience. Yet unlike dominant and secondary Ti, tertiary Ti can often lead sweeping generalizations induced from sparse evidence. Tertiary Ti leads can lead to a narcissistic focus on your own experience, or the experience of people who stand with you. If someone disagrees with you, then they must be naive. This kind of narrow view is often used defensively. Especially when combined with dominant Ni, tertiary Ti can be used to defend bizarre theories that are completely unfalsifiable. An example of tertiary Ti is the feminist concept of "authority of experience," and its use thereof. This concept is used to exalt the experience of women who toe the party line of feminism, but feminists aren't always so quick to acknowledge the experience of women (and men) who disagree with them. For example, a woman who works in the pornography industry and claims that she has been exploited is considered to be speaking gospel, but a woman who works in the porn industry and says that she enjoys it is speaking heresy.

### As an [[Inferior Function]]

Ti leads EFJs to...?

## As an Ethical Perspective

As an ethical perspective, Ti leads you to do the best for the system regardless of your relationship to it.

Take, for example, this anecdote from an [interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022326/http://www.juddhandler.com/articles/vincevaughn.php) with Vince Vaughan, who played "Trent" in the movie [Swingers](https://www.imdb.com/fr/title/tt0117802/?reasonForLanguagePrompt=browser_header_mismatch).

> **Vaughn**: The teachers thought I was crazy. I was sort of a wild kid. But I always felt like, if a kid is getting up to give a speech and he's starting to cry, he's gotta go to school with us for the rest of the year, and your f\*\*\*in' with him, making him stand up there. I'd tell the kid to sit down. And they'd say, "You can't tell him that, it's my class." And I'd say, “Give him a break on the speech, he just f\*\*\*in’ cried in front of you." What do you want? He's gotta go and hang out, he's gotta go to school for the rest of the day. You want him to sit up there the whole period and cry? And then when high school comes around he's the guy who cried forever? So I would get in a lot of trouble for that kind of stuff. I was always confident enough to say, "This is f\*\*\*in' crazy."

Vaughan is probably motivated by [[introverted feeling]] also, but his justification of his actions clearly demonstrates [[introverted thinking]]. It makes no sense that someone should have to give a speech when they are crying. Vaughan doesn't only employ pathos, but he appeals to the long-term consequences that the teacher's arbitrary use of power would _cause_ on the kid, such being made fun of. In doing so, he violates the rules of extraverted judgement that students should not question teachers. From his standpoint, there is nothing wrong with doing so, because he is appealing to principles that are much larger than arbitrary classroom rules and transcend the social roles of "student" and "teacher."

A similar simple example of the Ti approach to ethics would be a student correcting a teacher when they get something wrong. Of course, from the standpoint of Je[^1], correcting a teacher is not acceptable because it subverts the authority of the teacher. Yet from the standpoint of Ti, the teacher only holds authority to the extent that they are true to the material. Hence, by correcting a teacher, you aren't subverting their authority, but rather showing that their authority is an illusion in the first place. Your loyalty is to the material being taught, not to the teacher.

Quoting [[Carl Jung|Jung]]:

> In his own special field of work he provokes the most violent opposition, _which he has no notion how to deal with_, unless he happens to be seduced by his primitive affects into acrimonious and fruitless polemics.

## The Connection between Critical Thinking and Introverted Thinking

According to some of the definitions of Introverted Thinking, it seems as though this function can be described as taking a holistic, right-brained approach to observing and understanding the variables, causality, and inner-mechanics of an idea or situation. This information is generally too specific to [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|subjective]] experience and too ethereal for most [[Extraverted Thinking]] to understand.

The aspects of this general definition which seems to illuminate a connection between this function and most notions of Critical Thinking would be in how Critical Thinking is, much like Introverted Thinking contrasted to [[Extraverted Thinking]], involved in understanding the logical consistency inherent in the mechanics of an argument, idea or any system of principles which rely on self-consistency in order to function reliably. Critical thinking, unlike problem-solving, is less directed towards the application of ideas to a conflicting situation, and more concerned with the overall logical cogency of an intellectual construct, regardless of the construct's intentions towards the external. Furthermore, in order to use critical thinking effectively, one needs to have an understanding of a "situation's many variables", in order to judge that the "larger picture" is being sustained by the smaller components acting in synchronicity with one another, regardless of one's ability to interpret the rules from more linear processes.

Usually when I've come across the phrase "Critical Thinking" in practice, I've understood it to mostly refer to analysis of a claim or argument with the aim of (a) treating it as an idea to evaluate at second hand, and (b) rejecting it as being insufficiently justified (even though Critical Thinking is seldom, if ever, explicitly defined this way). By "second hand", I mean that the Critical Thinker treats the claim completely as something other people said rather than from first-hand experience, and consequently treating the claim without much regard for context, especially theories that would make it more or less plausible.

For example, when evaluating a claim of alternative medicine, one would ignore all theories within which the claim is meant to be understood, and view it simply as a recipe for cure: "perform this procedure, get these measurable results" rather than "attune yourself to this aspect of life, and from that attunement, perform this procedure, and you'll shift the person's body toward more harmony" (i.e. you have to be in tune with the theory to even perform the procedure). The basis for rejection is usually something to do with bias on the part of the person supplying the facts. "This person is a practitioner of the procedure, who charges a lot for it, so of course they're going to make a lot of factual claims that seem to support it."

Of course, the term "Critical Thinking" is vague, so different people probably use it to stand for many different things. The way I've just described it, though, suggests a left-brain state of mind. The emphasis on bias and the theory-less, context-less way of interpreting a claim suggest Introverted Intuition, and the emphasis on repeatable procedures and measurable results suggests Extraverted Thinking. Here's a (wow, testable!) hypothesis: maybe most people who get heavily invested in Critical Thinking are NTJs.

While I understand your mention of repeatable procedures and measurable results, and how that refers to the concept-based extraverted thinking approach, you seem to refer to an observation one makes ABOUT those procedures and measurable approaches. The Critical Thinking itself deviates from left-brain processes ( to some degree, anyway) in how there are usually very vague rules and concepts one applies when looking for "unjustified argument" as you put it, and correctly so, I believe. Seeing as though Extraverted Thinking, as defined by Lenore Thomson mainly anyway, seems to emphasize the extraction and application of predefined rules and concepts, and seeing as though Critical Thinking has to do with reacting to the immediate, structural aspects of an argument, I would argue that it seems Critical thinking is at least somehow aligned with Introverted Thinking. So far as Introverted Thinking doesn't rely on predefined rules to apply in order to make judgements about immediate, structural aspects of a situation. However, this comparison relies on Critical Thinking as being seen as a sort of "fuzzy logic" system, that is best dealt with by someone using a subjective criteria for deciding "the best questions to ask". Subjective, rational reaction seems to be very much Introverted Thinking. However, the closer the subject of critical thinking gets to FORMAL reasoning, and the land of clearly defined, concrete rules, the closer I believe this type of thinking gets to Extraverted Thinking. Also, your mention of "contextless" information is interesting. Indeed, Introverted Thinking is very much aligned with the ideas of looking at form and context. I think this may simply indicate something about the improvisational aspects of Introverted Thinking, and how the way one deals with a subject can change based on it's relation to environmental variables. In that sense, one could potentially state that there is form and context that is created WITHIN the set that is being looked at critically, which constantly evolves one's reaction to the entire situation, or subsets of it. I'd like to try and flesh this out more, but I'd like have to refresh my memory on some more specific examples of Critical Thinking.

Perhaps the less popular "Design Thinking" is more aligned with Introverted Thinking?

Far forethought based on inductive reasoning of current social/personal/etc situation. Less a focus on human dynamics than the tools, scientific methods, etc... that humans will use in the future.

**Opposing View**: Far forethought and distant extrapolation from the present suggest extraverted intuition rather than the "body-based reasoning" and "conversation with the material" that Lenore speaks of. Lenore's theory would be that NTP types often engage in this kind of extrapolation, since it brings to bear the "holistic, imaginal" orientation of Ti as well as the orientation toward context and the currently unknown that characterizes Ne. STP types, however, understand the world no less in holistic, Ti terms, but their emphasis is more on the present, especially on matters that bring immediate payoffs, are immediately verifiable, and connect with others by being immediately apparent and emotionally impactful (extraverted sensation).
