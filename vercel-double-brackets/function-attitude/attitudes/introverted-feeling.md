## Quasi-defining statements

> p. 41: "When we use [[Feeling]] in an [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|Introverted]] way, it operates as a kind of inner flame—a sense of personal values that may be difficult to explain or express directly but whose character informs our choices and inclinations."
>
> p. 366: "Introverted Feeling ... encourages a _personal_ relationship to an evolving pattern, a will to gauge the situation by an experiential ideal. For example, if we use Introverted Feeling to make a good spaghetti sauce, we won't follow recipes or measure ingredients. We'll sample the sauce as we're making it, gauging its taste, smell, and texture by their ideal outcome and adjusting for circumstantial variables so the emerging pattern stays on track."
>
> p. 367: "To invoke Introverted Feeling, we have to _know_ the difference between a good outcome and a bad one—know with our senses, in our bones \[on the basis of living, breathing, first-hand experience]."
>
> p. 370: "Introverted Feeling relies on the inward, right-brain criteria of experience and empathy to mark off decisions that go beyond our roles in society to affect us as human beings. Law and custom, after all, are the lowest common denominator of a defined community. We associate character and humane behavior with the moral imperatives shaped by inner values."
>
> p. 371: "An inner point of reference, one trained by personal experience. \[Bypassing matters of social standing] to focus on the quintessentially human."

## Proposed Definitions

### #1: [[Orienting|Orientation]] by self-expression

**Introverted Feeling** (Fi) is the attitude that everything that is manifest (apparent, observable, described) is the expression of a soul or life force, in terms of which everything ultimately makes sense. Everything that happens is the result of a _soul_ expressing its unique nature.

From this attitude, each living thing is completely unique, and has unique needs. Every living thing needs to express itself and grow in its unique way. None of this can be put into categories or measurements, at least not without blotting out that utter uniqueness of each living thing. Because we are all living things, even though each of us is unique we can still connect to the life force as it exists in others. From an Fi standpoint, the way to respond to things is in a way that is faithful to that underlying life force.

### #2: [[Orienting|Orientation]] by inner harmony

**Introverted Feeling** (Fi) is the attitude of judging things good or bad based on how they harmonize or clash with a living being's inner essence. That inner essence or soul, and how things in the environment get along with it or conflict with it, is knowable only first-hand—ultimately, only by that soul. It is known by attending to one's own emotions in response to things. What you like is good—for you, not necessarily good for others. What you don't like is bad—for you, not necessarily bad for others. Anything outside your own soul is irrelevant to evaluating anything or choosing your course in life.

### #3: [[Orienting|Orientation]] by emotional "grooves"

**Introverted Feeling** (Fi) is a framework of [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings#objective And Subjective|Subjective]] observations and values on the human experience. If [[Introverted Thinking#definition 2 Orientation By The Groove|Introverted Thinking]] can be defined as a culmination of logical 'grooves', Introverted Feeling can be defined as a culmination of emotional grooves.

What is a groove? It is an intuitive (in the layman sense) understanding of the 'laws' that govern us. As children we understand that things fall when they are dropped before we can learn what gravity is. Yet it is difficult to remember the first moment in which we discovered this lesson. We simply 'know'. It is an unconscious gestalt of past experiences and lessons.

Therefore, an Fi groove is a gestalt of experiences and lessons within the realm of [[Feeling]]. It is often anchored in the Fi user's experiences due to the [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings#objective And Subjective|Subjective]] nature of Fi and is continuously refining its framework by examining the self and others.

There is an underlying belief that in understanding the self, one can understand the human experience more deeply. And by understanding the human experience, we can understand people from any walk of life. To pass erroneous judgment on another demonstrates that a person has a flawed understanding of what the human experience is.

Because of this, Fi users often have a natural dislike for painting others with broad strokes or judging social and emotional situations too quickly. An important lesson could be learned, a misinterpretation could be happening, and an opportunity to refine the Fi framework could be lost.

When Fi is underdeveloped, it is often stubborn and solipsistic—unable to understand and accept values too different than theirs. When it is more developed, it recognizes the depth of others' frameworks: "What is right for me may not be right for you; we are operating from different values, beliefs and needs."

## As a language of [[Ego Orientation]]

As a [[Dominant Function]], Fi leads IFPs to live a life based on empathy and harmony between self and others—and/or to see life as a never-ending conflict between souls that are intrinsically different and opposed. ISFPs typically seek out a space in which they can be completely and spontaneously themselves, following their artistic impulses without regard to social expectation or definition of any sort. Some do their best to live life as a soap opera: creating and living out intense drama wherever they go. INFPs typically seek to _understand_ the world in terms of drama, emotion, and people seeking their own unique callings (perhaps Garrison Keillor is a good example of that). Some, like John Gray, attempt to help others understand each other through empathy with each other's differences, and thereby find peace and synergy.

Developed Fi naturally leads people to favor mercy or forgiveness for people who have done heinous acts—anything from theft to murder to genocide—acts that, under the ordinary laws that make a society manageable (see [[Extraverted Thinking]]), would usually merit their imprisonment or execution. From a developed Fi perspective, the criminal is still a living soul, still unique and precious despite whatever he may have done. If we walked in his moccasins for a while, maybe we could see it his way. Without condoning his crimes, maybe we could see how we ourselves could have done the same things under similar circumstances. This use of empathy as one's ultimate anchor of orientation leads to a resolute non-judgementalness. _First_ empathize—find something in your own heart that lets you see how someone could feel and act the way he did—and then you will probably find that you no longer feel hatred or a desire for retribution.

As a [[Secondary Function]], Fi typically leads EFPs to tune into the unmet needs and callings of others—as an avenue to making a sale, as a way to intuit what would entertain people, as a channel to political gain by demonstrating that you understand people's pain (e.g. Bill Clinton), as a way to chart a course through life based on a calling felt to be unique to them. Sometimes it leads them to sense a higher calling to answer to, a sense that their actions have cosmic meaning by virtue of how they aid or hinder life.

As a [[Tertiary Function]], Fi typically leads ITJs to retreat into solitary actions that have no constructive worldly effect but are aimed at providing a justification for calling themselves good people. Another example is obsession with the purity of one's soul. For example, being a vegetarian while working at Taco Bell—not out of any great love for animals (the person might hardly know anything about what cows are like), but to be able to say, "Well, at least _I_ never ate any animals." Or engaging in pointless acts of honor, like maintaining super-self-control or "doing one's duty" or going down with the ship. Nothing is gained by going down with the ship; it's a hyper-introverted act aimed at providing a rationalization for one's goodness without regard to real-world consequences. Nearly all of these tertiary-Fi acts involve _refraining_ from action viewed as unethical rather than taking positive action that would accomplish something. They're a retreat from the world—or rather, a rationalization for disregarding worldly matters.

As an [[Inferior Function]], Fi typically leads ETJs to acts of self-destructive hedonism, creation of opera-like drama in their lives and the lives of those around them, obsession with "integrity" (like going down with the ship), instant and irresponsible abandonment of anything they don't like (the opposite of going down with the ship), and bizarre solitary acts of atonement for the harms they've done to others. Sometimes inferior-Fi leads ETJs to preach and even practice a sort of hyper-selfishness, e.g. Ayn Rand and the Landmark Forum, "_I'm_ doing fine, so why should I give a damn about you?" (Very different from highly developed Fi, which leads you to see all people as connected and the highest joy of life as the experience of that connection.)

Tertiary and inferior Fi also sometimes lead TJs to view large numbers of people as "troglodytes": soulless or stupid creatures whose rotten situations in life derive only from their own intrinsic rottenness-of-soul. To take a comic example, [Lex Luthor](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022310/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Lex_Luthor)'s lamentation in _Superman_, "Why is the world's greatest criminal genius surrounded by nincompoops?"

Perhaps the most typical manifestation of tertiary and inferior Fi is an attitude of psychologizing other people: a sort of pseudo-empathy in which one explains other people's behavior in terms of pitiful needs and psychological flaws that anyone would be ashamed to have. "Notice the defensiveness. He clings desperately to his ideas. Such weakness." (Nearly all psychological theories offer plenty of ammo for psychologizing, including [[Lenore Thomson]]'s ideas.) Where developed Fi leads you to find something in your own soul in terms of which to truly understand someone else and see things their way, tertiary and inferior Fi typically lead you to find something in your own soul that you despise, in terms of which you can "explain" them and justify putting them down.

Naturally, you can see plenty of dominant-style Fi in ETJs, secondary-style Fi in IFPs, and so on—even inferior-style Fi in IFPs.

## As an introverted judgement attitude

Introverted feeling is judgement with an emotional slant that causes the individual to view the object on a [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|Subjective]] level. It is primarily a silent inaccessible function that is difficult to conceptualize. Therefore, unlike its extraverted counterpart, [[Extraverted Feeling]], it is entirely individualistic, with a leaning toward the mystical. Introverted feeling is generally disconnected with typical external stimuli. Introverted feeling is only concerned with the external to the extent that the object has some relevance to a deep, internal value. Its primary objective is to harmonize ideologies, concepts, relationships etc. with the internal guiding force.

Whatever the individual values the most will dominate the motivations, goals and chief objectives of the individual. For example, if the primary value is God, then all other values will find themselves inexorably subjugated to this primary one. Often, unbalanced introverted feeling will create in the individual dramatic mood swings and decisions based on illogical rationales. However, at its best, introverted feeling provides a navigational quality that creates in the personality tenacity, idealism, honor, relationship wisdom and a unfaltering value system that is seldom compromised.
