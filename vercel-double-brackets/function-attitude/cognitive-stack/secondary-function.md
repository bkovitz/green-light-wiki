An alternate or auxiliary [[Function Attitude]] in addition to one's [[Dominant Function]].

The **Secondary Function** gives extraverts access to something beyond what is immediately apparent or applicable; and it gives introverts access to public, worldly matters. A person's Secondary Function doesn't directly conflict with the person's [[Dominant Function]] even though it's [[Orienting|Oriented]] by the opposite world (extraverted/introverted).

One of [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]]'s [[Main Propositions]] seems to be that the Secondary Function often provides a person's main path of growth, once they've established a definite personalityâ€”one strong enough to start running into self-created limitations.

Some explorations of how this might work are on [[Saints And Politicians Exegesis|Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis]], [[Place Your Stakes Exegesis|Place-Your-Stakes Exegesis]], and [[Checks and Balances]].
