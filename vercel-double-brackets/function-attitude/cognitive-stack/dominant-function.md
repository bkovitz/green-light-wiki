The primary [[Function Attitude|function-attitude]] that a person uses for [[Ego Orientation]].

In [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]]'s view, the dominant and [[Secondary Function|secondary functions]] are opposed enough to cause some internal conflict, but compatible enough that they generate synergy and intelligent adaptation and individuation pretty quickly and easily.

Some explorations of how this might work are on [[Parliament Of Attitudes|Parliament of Attitudes Exegesis]], [[Checks and Balances]], [[Saints And Politicians Exegesis|Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis]] and [[Place Your Stakes Exegesis|Place-Your-Stakes Exegesis]].
