## About this site

An introduction to the archived Lenore Exegesis Wiki is available at [[About This Wiki]] if you're curious about the wiki's primary purpose.

If you're looking for information about the site you are reading now, then the rest of this page will be of interest to you.

### Why the Lenore Thomson Exegesis wiki?

This site's host enjoyed reading it and found great insight from it as a teen; perhaps you will too. Maybe it comes from a sense of yearning for when the internet was a little warmer, more personable. Maybe it's from a life-long interest in trying to understand others. Maybe it's a bit of nostalgia for an old interest I had.

My personal favourite pages were [[How To Experience Different Function Attitudes|How to Experience Different Function-Attitudes]] and the subpages for each [[function attitude]]. These were what changed my perception on the types, personality in general, and cognition. I began to understand more deeply how differently people can think and perceive the same information. If you and I are similar, you will likely enjoy them as well.

### Have you changed anything from the original?

The format of the site is quite different. This is structured more as a documentation site, but it is designed to be edited, commented upon, etc.

There are liberties taken with the formatting, organisation, and what is archived. For example, certain pages are now merged into others (e.g. **Extraversion** and **Introversion** as [[Function Attitude]] and [[Index|Introversion-Extraversion Exegeses]]. Shorter pages are left unarchived.

### How to participate here

The principles of the original [[How to Participate Here]] still apply with some exceptions.

My personal caveat is to avoid idle talk on the pages themselves. This is just to keep things tidy. There is a [discussion board](https://github.com/apriltaoyvr/thomson-exegesis/discussions) available on the Github repo for sharing your thoughts. Adding additional theories, observations, etc. is always welcome on the pages themselves though.

There are likely leftover links that direct to [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) pages rather than their internal equivalents. If you see leftover internal links that have a matching page, please redirect them to the corresponding page. External links (to outside of the wiki) should be left as they are or directed to an appropriate live alternative.

I am currently debating if more personal pages (e.g. author subpages) should be archived on here.
