An hypothesis is an inductive use from which theories are derived from individual data points, or the meshing of other hypotheses. As used on this wiki, hypotheses aren't inductive hypotheses, they are deductive hypothetical data points.

_Robert, I don't follow that. What I mean by "hypothesis" is an idea to be entertained. Calling something a hypothesis is an invitation to explore its implications, look for ways to test it, look for reasons why it might be true, and look for reasons why it might be false. â€”[Ben Kovitz](https://web.archive.org/web/20070123104346/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Ben_Kovitz)_
