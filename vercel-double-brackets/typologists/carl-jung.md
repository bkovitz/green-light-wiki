**Carl Jung** wrote [_Psychological Types_](https://www.amazon.ca/Psychological-Types-Carl-Jung/dp/1138687421), a foundational work behind [[Lenore Thomson|Thomson]]'s _Personality Type: An Owner's Manual_. One could argue he's the granddaddy of these systems ([Thomson](./lenore-thomson)'s, [[Myers Briggs|MBTI]], Socionics, etc.).

## Psychological Types

In Psychological Types, Jung proposed the basic distinction between extraversion and introversion, and further proposed that there are four functions through which we have conscious experience, each capable of being directed in an extraverted or introverted way.

Jung proposed eight psychological types, each with a different [[dominant function]]:

Four "rational types":

An [[Extraverted Thinking]] type.
An [[Introverted Thinking]] type.
An [[Extraverted Feeling]] type.
An [[Introverted Feeling]] type.

Four "irrational types":

An [[Extraverted Sensation]] type.
An [[Introverted Sensation]] type.
An [[Extraverted Intuition]] type.
An [[Introverted Intuition]] type.

How much commonality is there between [[Lenore Thomson]]'s stuff and Carl Jung's? That's an open question and a great topic for posting to this wiki.

## Jung's Type

### Hypothesis: ISTJ

As evidenced in the way he built his type system (within the confines of the book _Psychological Types_):

_Psychological Types_, Ch. 11, Definitions:

> It may perhaps seem superfluous that I should add to my text a chapter dealing solely with definitions. _But ample evidence has taught me that_, in psychological works particularly, one cannot proceed to **cautiously** in regard to the _concepts and terms_ one uses: for nowhere do such wide divergences of meaning occur as in the domain of psychology, creating only too frequently the most obstinate _misunderstandings_.

[[Lenore Thomson|_Lenore_]]_,_ p. 188:

> They are masters of gradual, almost imperceptible modification. They tinker here, shore up there, solve problems and rectify ambiguities, all the while preserving the best of what exists, scarcely recognizing that in the process, they've adapted form quite brilliantly to function.
>
> Such types can find it difficult to limit and organize the data of their mental world without an _external reference point_ to guide them.
>
> Introverted sensation motivates ISTJs to _acquire facts and to retain them_ (memory), but it offers no way to discriminate among them rationally (see prior sentence).
>
> they can strike others as overly **cautious** and unyielding workaholics.

If he isn't an ISTJ, he's most likely an INTJ.

### Hypothesis: INTJ

The overall thrust of Jung's theories is to characterize people's beliefs and the ways in which they find meaning, with little or no regard for the possibility that their beliefs are true, but instead viewing people's beliefs as artifacts of innate myth-generating faculties of the mind. A slightly off-beat example is that his investigation of UFOs was not about UFOs at all, but about the shapes of supposed UFOs and what they revealed about the mental state and myth-generating faculties of the UFO-believers. His take on Christianity is not to assess whether Jesus really was resurrected or even existed and what that implies for human life, but to assess (for example) the asymmetry of the Christian cross and what that implies about Christianity as a regulative force in people's lives. Whatever anyone says or thinks or even feels—our conscious life in general—in Jung's view, is merely a story emerging from unconscious processes: vast, mind-bogglingly complex systems that serve various conflicting interests, all of which is mostly inaccessible at the conscious level.

This fits the "about the box" attitude of [[Dominant Function|dominant]] [[introverted intuition]].

The distant, coldly impersonal attitude toward his subjects suggests a [[thinking]] attitude. Viewing all explicitly stated reasons for behavior as merely a socially workable cover story—not *true* but merely serving to make life manageable—is the typical form that [[Judgement|extraverted judgement]] takes in INJs.
