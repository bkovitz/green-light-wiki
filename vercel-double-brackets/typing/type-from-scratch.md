The [[Definition Problem]] leads some of us to wonder: what sorts of real-world observations lead to drawing the distinctions of type theory and framing its propositions?

For example, if we didn't already "know" that someone who tests ESTP has [[Dominant Function|dominant]] [[Extraverted Sensation|Extraverted Sensing]] and [[Secondary Function|secondary]] [[Introverted Thinking]], what sorts of observations would lead us to figure that out?

## Some observations that seem to correlate with functions and attitudes

When you first meet an extravert, he seems to be a very clear-cut, definite person who knows who he is and what he's doing. The more you get to know an extravert, the more diffuse he seems to become, until you start wondering if there is any person inside there at all.

When you first meet an introvert, he seems to have no personality at all. He barely seems to exist. The more you get to know an introvert, the more definite he seems to become. You start seeing a very clear-cut, unmistakable person who knows who he is and what he's doing. And then you see him in a group situation, and he seems to dissolve into nothing again.

The relation between question and advice that [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]] reports in the writings of [[Developing The Secondary#advice Columnists|Advice Columnists]].

A conversation between two NPs has a distinct pattern: you could call it [[Perception|Holistic Spiraling]]. When NJs talk together or an NP talks with an NJ, the spiraling seldom takes off even though there's still lots of reframing of ideas.

The peculiar disconnect that nearly always happens between INTJs and INTPs. From the INTJ's standpoint: "He seems awfully attached to his model, as if it's the only possible one. There are so many possibilities he hasn't ruled out. His argumentation is simply unfair: he is choosing observations to stack the deck to favor his interpretation over all others. He seems oblivious to the complexity of the subject. He does not seem to know what he's doing." From the INTP's standpoint: "I'm trying to point things out and draw distinctions in order to define a vocabulary that carves out _some_ aspect of the subject matter. That would be forward progress. But he refuses to look. He keeps translating everything I say into some moronic vocabulary that he's already familiar with, where what I'm saying is a trivial goof. He seems completely stuck in his box."

[[Type Clash]] in general: the specific ways in which people's assumptions about the unwritten rules of conversation or cooperation fail when they encounter people with different assumptions. Lenore's concepts might explain [[Type Clash]] in terms of different ways of finding the same things meaningful or meaningless.

The staleness of the Analytic Philosophy world, presumably a magnet for INTJs who don't want to deal with anything tangible or of real consequence. The SFP-like fashion-following of much of academia (well, much of the humanities), where demonstrating that you are intellectually "hip" to all the latest fads and a craving for originality blots out the search for and teaching of timeless insights. Inferior [[Extraverted Sensation]]?

The peculiar difficulty that INJs often have in giving examples for their ideas. Asking for an example often strikes them as missing the point. Is this because of the way [[Introverted Intuition|Introverted Intuitions]] "aren't really ideas"?

ISTPs often take the same wry, distant, "commenting" attitude that Lenore ascribes to INJs, even to the point of being "seen as oracles and prophets". [[Tertiary Function|Tertiary]] [[Introverted Intuition]] could be the basis of the attitude of "commenting from the outside" seen in [[The Onion]].

## Imagine a zoo

Imagine that we have a zoo full of people, with several critters from each of the 16 [[Myers Briggs|MBTI]] types. Assume that we have them correctly sorted according to their [[Myers Briggs|MBTI]] types, but that we have no prior knowledge of [[Myers Briggs|MBTI]] theory or [[Carl Jung|Jung]]'s _Psychological Types_. We don't have the four-letter codes to even suggest the existence of things like "[Dominant Function](../main/function-attitude/attitudes/dominant-function)," or that we should clump eight of the types as "Ts," and thus assume that there exists a "Tness"—we have nothing but our observations and interactions with the types to guide us.

Of course this thought experiment is a psychological impossibility—we _do_ have prior knowledge of PT theory, and it's impossible to know what exactly we would infer if we didn't. But that is what I am at least striving for when I try to work without certain PT assumptions and see if they end up really being necessary.

So, let's go back into the PT zoo...

Like I said, I'm just talking to the people and observing them interact; i.e., I don't have access to PET scans of their brains while they compute multiplication tables etc. The idea that each type is distinguished by a certain way of consciously seeing itself in relation to the rest of the world seems like a very natural first place to start. As Jerry pointed out to Scot (or at least as I understood him), even if the types amount to neural algorithms that can be explained by EP, the conclusions we draw should still check out at the level of human consciousness and identity. On the other hand, perhaps because of my own type, I choose human consciousness as the place from which to start exploring the types, and while the conclusions I draw shouldn't contradict anything that a neurosurgeon might discover, that level of exploration doesn't interest me much. — \[For a margin note: the conclusions we draw that show conscious effect (which is not necessarily all, or isn't necessarily either what humans call identity) should match up — Robert Evans]

So, that's all I mean when I say that "a type is a pattern of identity construction." For example, I observe that everyone in the ENFJ cage sees themself as living in a world of visible human relationships whose existence is maintained in easily recognizable ways—a self-image they have in common with the folks in the ESFJ cage. The ENFJs also have a need to see themselves as having a direct part in the formation of relationships that others would not have thought possible, or to be the catalyst in other peoples' development of their talents. This they share to some extent with those weird headpatting people in the next cage over.

That was a very condensed description, but I consider it a "definition" of ENFJ in the sense that \*every\* ENFJ maintains such an identity, and no one not in the ENFJ cage (if the imager of people behind bars is starting to bother you as it is me, get rid of the zoo metaphor :) also maintains this identity. I am not claiming that there does not exist a neurological way of distinguishing the type from each other—those would just be equivalent definitions, in the same what that measure can be defined in terms of set-functions or linear functionals. In fact, there most certainly \*is\* going to turn out to be differences between peoples' brains along PT lines.

This is about where I am with type theory, namely, that each type has a distinct way in which its self-image is built. This viewpoint, yes, was inspired by Lenore's book.

I don't yet, however, see any necessity for the concept of a "function." Not simply that I don't know how to define it, but I just don't see any natural motivation for the concept. This, I think, is the real "genus problem" that Ben posts about from time to time. Just because there is a deep similarity between ESFJs and ENFJs, for example, why should I think there is some cognitive process that both of these types are engaging in most of the time—one that I-FJs are inclined to use as well to a lesser extent, and which I-TPs have some special access to that TJs don't, etc.

Or what would ever make me think that I—Js and E—Ps have in common that they are both constantly "taking in information," as [[Myers Briggs|Myers]] would have it. Yes, IN-Js tend to resist building their homes within any particular conceptual framework, and you might be able find analogous ways in which IS-Js are non-committal in their attitude. And yes, certainly E—Ps are untiring in their quest for stimulating experiences and ideas. But to call I—Js and E—Ps both [[Perception|perceivers]], as if one is just doing what the other is doing, only in-side-out, seems like a real stretch.

Jerry has expressed many times on this list his observation that [[Introverted Intuition|Ni]] and [[Extraverted Intuition|Ne]] share only some very superficial similarities, and if it weren't for the big letter N at the beginning of each, it might not ever occur to him to think of them as two versions of the same thing. The same might be true of Ti and Te. The reason no one has said the same thing about F and S might just be that these functions don't get as much airtime on this list.

Anyway, you can see what I'm doing here. I'll fastforward to the [[inferior function]] issue.

Unless some very strong suggestions can be found that something like what we think of as "functions" form the building blocks of type, then what do we mean by "[inferior function](../main/function-attitude/cognitive-stack/inferior-function)"? Naomi Quenk seems to answer this question with her idea that each type becomes a caricature of its opposite (the notion of a type having an "opposite" would be a very difficult thing to define in my hypothetical PT zoo situation, without the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] superstructure already in place) when under severe stress. In other words, INFJs start behaving like very childish ESTPs when they are in the "grip." I know lots of people for whom this idea rings true, and a lot for whom it does not (including myself). I do see how the parts of myself that I disown can come back to sabotage my conscious efforts when I become too entrenched in my "Ni," but I don't see that the sabotage is particularly ESTP-like.

However you define an [[inferior function]], the idea should be translatable into statements about relationships between actual types, or so it would seem. I.e., anything you can say about an INFJ's [[inferior function]] should be about a relationship between INFJs and ESTPs, be it one of cariacturization, or, as in the gearshift model, one in which INFJs have a special ability to use the ESTP's favorite cognitive processes, even though they are not preferred. If you can't say something like, "INFJs, like ESTPs, tend to do blah blah, only with a certain blah blah slant to it," then the idea of INFJs using [[Inferior Function|inferior]] [[Extraverted Sensation|Se]] just seems like "abstract nonsense" to me.
