Jean Teasdale, [[The Onion]] editorialist, rocks my world.

## ISFJ or INTP?

Interesting puzzle here, maybe able to shed a lot of light on Lenore's ideas about [[Function Attitude|function attitudes]] and psychological types.

ISFJ seems like the obvious guess: endlessly concerned with [[Extraverted Feeling|Fe]] demonstrations of where one stands, but stuck in a bizarre, quirky set of idiosyncratic ways of understanding the social vocabulary ([Si](../../main/function-attitude/attitudes/introverted-sensation)), and baffled that no one else is in sync with it.

_However, I know two women in person who are remarkably similar to Jean Teasdale. One of them even married a boor who sounds a lot like Hubby Rick. And both of these women came out INTP on the [[Myers Briggs|Myers-Briggs]] test. —[Ben Kovitz](https://web.archive.org/web/20101218133147/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Ben_Kovitz)_

I agree with ISFJ. There is no idea orientation. If the women you mention aren't idea or impersonal spatial-orientation oriented, etc... then they've most likely been mistyped. At any rate, I can't imagine a Ti being happy about being involved in something like this. —[Robert Evans](https://web.archive.org/web/20101218133147/http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis/Robert_Evans)
