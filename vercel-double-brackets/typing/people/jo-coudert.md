## Jo Coudert as an INFJ

Jo Coudert's famous message is: don't try to change the self; instead, try to know the self and be the self. Total self-acceptance achieved by never-ending self-examination. Self, self, self, self, self, self, self.

### Introverted intuition

[[Introverted Intuition]] would show up in her view that anything that you say about the self will be wrong: the opposite will be true also, and it will get more and more out of your control the more you hold to a view of self that excludes it.

She views with skepticism any account of external causes as necessitating a person's behavior or creating their situation. A person claims that others are mistreating him: she proposes that the person is getting himself into those situations by virtue of the way he responds. For example, the person might be unconsciously replaying an old conflict with a parent, hoping it will come out better this time. Only, it never will, and the person won't realize this until they look at their own self more carefully, more "objectively". You need to step outside your own system of interpretations and responses to see how it's preventing the falseness of those interpretations from being discovered—the classic Ni shift. By looking at your actions as if you were a detective, you can discover patterns over time, revealing hidden or unacknowledged or even actively denied aspects of the self that are interfering with your ability to act in a fully conscious and intelligent manner.

Understanding oneself as something completely self-contained—everything that "counts" is inside the self, worldly results are of no concern except insofar as they provide opportunity to know and be oneself—is an extremely introverted point of view. The idea that *awareness* of the infinite and ineffable world of the inner self is the principal job of the self is a very pure illustration of [[introverted intuition]] as a [[dominant function]]. It's almost a sort of ethical solipsism. However, in her next major piece of advice, she augments this extreme introversion without undermining it:

### Extraverted Feeling

[[Extraverted feeling]] would show up in her view that the self must "act in the world." She says that the self only *is* when it engages the world outside.

When she gets to tangible advice, it's mostly advice for *negotiating* with others: defining what you want to do, letting them define what they want to do, and saying yea or nay based on how you really feel. That's where you interface with others, and it's best not to try to reach inside them and attempt to make changes.

While there is some sophistication in her understanding of negotiation—e.g. her awareness that people sometimes change their own mind, but their minds are not changed by trying to "sue" them into changing—she doesn't seem to take it very far. For example, she has little concept of making a counteroffer, the use of offers to gather information, or in general the ways in which one self can push things to its own advantage against another in the real-world arena. This suggests an overall introverted approach to [[Negotiation Exegesis|negotiation]].

## Extraverted Sensation

Suffice to say, it's not exactly a [[Dominant Function|dominant]]-[extraverted sensation](../main/function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted_sensation) viewpoint that leads her to find that being oneself is so difficult. Her writing oscillates between pushing a hyper-introspectiveness about oneself and wanting to hand over the reins to one's spontaneous instincts—to fully trust the self. She seems to see the latter as the highest state to be in, perhaps unaware that people who are really like that are folks like James Gandolfini and Rodney Dangerfield, presumably not folks that she would find inspiring.

## Contrast with Eric Berne

An interesting contrast with an extraverted point of view can be found in [[Eric Berne]]'s analyses of how and why people engage in self-defeating behaviors.

Berne offers a fairly cursory analysis of the motives and needs at the root of behavior that is overtly aimed at something respectable and covertly aimed at maintaining something rotten. He offers virtually no advice for discovering what might be leading you to do these things. Instead, he offers advice for negotiating with other people who are doing them: an "antithetical" action that will throw them off balance, forcing them—perhaps painfully—to find a new balance and a more honest self-understanding and way of interacting with others. He also suggests that you not play an antithesis in most situations, because "games" are inherent in getting along with people, and the cost to yourself—the cost in worldly terms, like losing your job—might be too great.
