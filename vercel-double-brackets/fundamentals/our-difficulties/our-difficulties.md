## General

- The [[Genus Problem]]: just what are these "[Function Attitudes](../fundamentals/function-attitude)", anyway?
- What do different forms of the same [[function attitude]], but in different positions, have to do with each other? For example, [[Introverted Sensation]] as a [[dominant function]] seems to be a concern with holding certain priorities intact. But for INTPs, [[Introverted Sensation]] takes the form of psychosomatic disorders or paranoia about whether one's food is poisonous. What do these have in common?
  - Speculative answer: The degree a [[function attitude]] strays from the primary strength is the degree to which it becomes unhealthy. Lenore uses an example of a psychologist who thought mixing tomatoes and dairy was deadly. An example of taking the "[subjective](../our-difficulties/terms-with-nonobvious-meanings)", filtered approach to identifying and giving value to concrete things in ones environment. More healthy (when in [[Dominant Function|primary]] or [[Secondary Function|secondary]]) versions of [[Introverted Sensation|introverted sensing]] which, like the above example, use a [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|subjective]] approach to valuing external, concrete things, but with a much more refined and developed style that lends more to organization than irrational beliefs.
- [[Why These Eight]]?
- Why is there any conflict between [[Function Attitude|Function Attitudes]]? For example, couldn't one just use [[Extraverted Thinking]] and [[Introverted Feeling]] as heuristics at appropriate times, without there being any conflict? Why must there be an [[Inferior Function]], messing up what the others do?
  - Speculative answer 1: Maybe because humans tend to see their [[Inferior Function|inferior functions]] as "evil". Some ISTPs, for example, tend to see [[Extraverted Feeling]] as unhealthy conformism. One can actually use one's [[dominant function]] and [[inferior function]] at appropriate times, but unfortunately it is the nature of the human brain to view the inferior as evil and stick to the dominant attitude. This is related to the [[Carl Jung|Jungian theory]] that the inferior is pushed to the shadow.
  - Speculative answer 2: Maybe because the [[inferior function]] is too weak to have a "feel" of its realm. To illustrate, ETJs (with [[Inferior Function|inferior]] [[Introverted Feeling]]) can hardly sense the "soul in all things" that IFPs easily pick up. ITPs don't have a good feel for social roles, which are the domain of their inferior [[Extraverted Feeling]]. Consequently, even if the ITP wants to use his [[Extraverted Feeling]] for socializing, he gets into difficulties because he wasn't very aware of social roles all along. This is why it's easier to use the [[Secondary Function]] to fulfil the inferior's aims indirectly: the [[secondary function]] has a stronger feel. E.g. ISTPs might not sense roles well, but their secondary [[Extraverted Sensation|Extraverted Sensing]] knows what will make people like them on a visceral level, and they use that knowledge for socializing. — Rapture of the Blade (ISTP)
- At the end of the day, what does each type want their story to say?

## Introversion and Extraversion

- What do the introverted and extraverted forms of the same function have to do with each other? For example, [[Extraverted Intuition]] seems to be guessing the whole from seeing a few parts. Introverted Intuition seems to be thinking up alternative interpretations and denying that anything true can be said. Why do those both have the name "intuition"?
  - Speculative answer 1: In the chapter on [[Extraverted Intuition]] and [[Introverted Intuition]], they are referred to as "speculative", or being consumed with the process of generating possibilities beyond the immediate. From an introverted orientation, it generates "interpretations". However, from an extroverted orientation, it "hypotheses".
- What do the introverted forms of the functions all have in common?
  - Speculative answer: The introverted functions are [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|subjective]] and are concerned with 'universal truths'. Where extraverted attitudes rely on contextual objectivity (i.e. What is provable within the context of a situation and/or according to an external standard), introverted attitudes are concerned with underlying principles that can be used across contexts. There is a bit of irony that the [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|subjective]] functions search for universal truths and the [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|objective]] functions search for contextual truths.
- What do the extraverted forms of the functions all have in common?
  - Speculative answer 1: [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|Objectivity]] is the element which ties all of the extraverted attitudes together. Even [[extraverted intuition]] starts from an [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|objective]] situation, deriving the [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|subjective]] only as long as an [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings#objective And Subjective|objective]] root is present. [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings#objective And Subjective|Objectivity]] can also be looked at as more extraverted than introverted in that objectivity is viewed as being true and immutable, thus impervious to being changed by one's internal, subjective, or "introverted" analysis.
- What do extraverts have to gain by developing an introverted attitude? It seems obvious what introverts gain by developing an extraverted attitude: money, power, a social position, etc. Why can't extraverts just focus on their extraverted concerns with no function-related problems?
  - See [[Saints And Politicians Exegesis|Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis]] and [[Place Your Stakes Exegesis|Place-your-Stakes Exegesis]] for theories. Developing more nuance and refining the systems and frameworks you live by only has benefits. You make poor decisions otherwise. This requires introverted orientation by Lenore's definition.
- Do ESFPs even care? Or Extraverts for that matter?
  - We do -ENFP

See [[Index|Introversion-Extraversion Exegeses]] for [[Exegesis|exegeses]] on what introversion and extraversion mean in Lenore's terms.

## Some word choices and metaphors

- Who is Alice?
  - "When we rely on our [[dominant function]] for all our answers, we usually wind up like Alice, running hard just to stay in place." p. 84
  - It almost certainly is a reference to Alice in Wonderland, namely this passage from *Through the Looking Glass*: "The most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all: however fast they went, they never seemed to pass anything. 'I wonder if all the things move along with us?' thought poor puzzled Alice. And the Queen seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried, 'Faster! Don't try to talk!'"
- What are [[Altars in the Wilderness]]?

## Why some functions are hard to describe

In this wiki, as Lenore's book, some functions seem harder to describe. For instance, describing [[Extraverted Thinking]] is easier than describing [[Extraverted Feeling]]. This has nothing to do with the complexity of the each function. It has to do with the nature of the functions in relation to the medium in which they are expressed.

We are trying to agree upon words and their meanings to see Lenore's ideas more clearly. We are describing [[Extraverted Thinking]] in an [[Extraverted Thinking]] medium; therefore Extraverted Thinking is easy to express. A wiki will never grasp the full meaning of Extraverted Feeling. The same way that Soap Operas will never grasp the full meaning of Extraverted Thinking.

This is even more noticeable with opposite functions. Such as [[Extraverted Sensation]] and [[Introverted Intuition]]. Movies seem doom to fail at grasping the meaning of Introverted Intuition. And methodical essays will never explain what Extraverted Sensation is truly about.

This is good news! Our understanding of the functions should increase surprisingly once we figure out which mediums belong the most to which function. And there is at least one medium that is fair to all functions, the Modern Novel.
