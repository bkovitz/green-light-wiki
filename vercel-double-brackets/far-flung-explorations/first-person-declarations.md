## A style of conversation

First-person declarations, in the sense intended on this page, are statements that declare the speaker's opinion about some subject, with little or no justification, and in first-person language: "*I* hold/believe/think such-and-such" (but see below).

For example:

- "I think Debussy is better than Ravel."
- "I think Queen Anne tables are nice."
- "I say the Red Sox are going to win the World Series this year!"
- "I think that music is too loud."
- "I vote that we go to a Vietnamese restaurant."
- "God exists in my house!" (a line from A Raisin in the Sun)
- "I say [[George Costanza]] is an ESFP."

"I" language is not strictly necessary for a first-person declaration. One can say "George W. Bush is a rotten president!" without explicitly using a first-person pronoun. The force of the statement is still a declaration of where the speaker stands.

Sometimes in English, "I think" expresses uncertainty rather than asserting the speaker's opinion. Normally context is required to tell the difference. The above examples have no context; the intention is that they're assertions of the speaker's opinion, not expressions of uncertainty.

## Hypothesis: F, often mixed up with T (but not necessarily)

When people state opinions in "I" language, they are trying to express a preference that comes "from the heart" rather than from logical inference or direct observation. They are expressing personal feelings. This is obvious in the case of expressions of value judgements like the one about Queen Anne tables. One converts one's from-the-heart preference or feeling into words, communicating it to others. This is a [[Feeling]] [[Function Attitude|attitude]], plain and simple.

The lack of justification is because a [[feeling]] [[judgement]] is simply a raw datum: it emerges "from the heart", not by logical inference. It's about *you*—hence the (usual) first-person wording.

It's no less a declaration of feeling, though, when a factual or non-value statement is declared. "I say the Red Sox are going to win the World Series!" is a declaration of your feelings of personal loyalty to the Red Sox. It's putting those feelings into a verbal form that makes it very easy for others to know where you stand. This is no less true of statements like "The Mac is better than the PC", even if the actual motivation for saying so is to share a conclusion arrived at on the basis of facts and reasons rather than feelings.

### Fe mixed up with Ti

[[Introverted Thinking]] judgements arise simultaneously from many, many factors considered at once—far more than can be conveyed in a linear, low-bandwidth[^1] medium like a rapid-exchange conversation or short tidbits posted onto an Internet bulletin board. The proposition itself can't easily be expressed, because just to understand what it says (not even to argue for it) requires the context of shared experience and/or many other idiosyncratic concepts and comparisons. Usually Ti judgements cannot be understood without also understanding their justification.

Consequently, a person who wants to inject a Ti judgement into a public space can easily be tempted to express it as a first-person declaration. This makes it hearable in the public space: *"I* say *this!!"* It also obliterates the idea and ruins the conversation, from a Ti perspective, because the rich context that gives the statement meaning is pared away. This illustrates [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]]'s principle that opposite [[Function Attitude|attitude]]s nullify each other.

By expressing a complex, right-brain inference as a first-person declaration, you translate it into the world of "the heart" in the social arena ([Extraverted Feeling](../function-attitude/attitudes/extraverted-feeling)). You are in effect saying that what bubbles up from your heart is a feeling of loyalty to the proposition "COBOL is a rotten computer language" or whatever it is. What you had intended as a way to lead a listener to see something deep about computer languages for himself comes out as a personal declaration of hostility toward some group of people, and a personal declaration of loyalty toward the like-minded. Now it's all about *you,* not the subject matter. Disagreement about the subject matter is now no longer an occasion to share knowledge and ideas, it's a personal relationship created through words: a relationship of mutual hostility, each demanding that the other bow down in shame for failing to grasp the truth of the proposition sooner. Pretty soon you're trying to paint the other guy as an idiot and make him play the role—almost the worst that [[Extraverted Feeling]] offers as a way of shaping a life.

Note that from a [[Index|type guess]]ing perspective, conflating Fe and Ti is not limited to ITPS. EFJs (or anyone) also can want to get across an idea that arises from a rich wealth of direct experience, with the hope that others will get in sync with it—find that same "groove". But lacking a slow and thoughtful conversational forum for it, EFJs are just as likely to try to force someone to back down to what they perceive as their superior experience and insight. "God exists in *my* house!"—an assertion of personal authority, overriding the child's judgement, because you think the child too inexperienced to appreciate religion on her own.

So what can you do instead? First, you have to accept that when it comes to introverted matters, you can't force them on someone else, even if they're genuine truth. You can only lead people to them indirectly. You need to appeal to some other extraverted attitude. Any extraverted attitude will give you a way to force a response from someone else. Of course, you don't control the response, and it might not be what you like. When it comes to politics, reason is not the coin of the realm. And in a low-bandwidth arena, not all ideas can be heard. (See [[Saints And Politicians Exegesis|Saints-and-Politicians Exegesis]].)

### Fi mixed up with Te

_Illustrations, anyone?_

[[Introverted Feeling]] prefers first person declarations such as "I feel/think/believe/etc." because it is connected to [[Extraverted Thinking]]'s preference for empiricism.

Is it true and verifiable that this TV show sucks? It's hard to say. There's no simple external standard for it. But is it verifiable that _I_ think this TV show sucks and have claimed that? Yes and easily so.

There is a strong desire in Fi to draw a clear line between what is the "self" and what is the "other". By saying "_I_ like cats more than dogs" (rather than "cats are better than dogs"), the speaker broadcasts a piece of their **self** to you.

### Exceptions

The reason for the "not necessarily" is that sometimes one states a proposition boldly, without justification, and attached to yourself, not as an attempt to force an extraverted arena to conform to introverted needs, but as a way of genuinely participating in the extraverted arena.

#### Betting

The simplest example is a bet. If you've come by careful reasoning to a belief in a high probability that the Red Sox will win the World Series this year, and you think most other people are wrong, you have another option beside trying to persuade them. You can place a bet and take their money (if you win). This is known as "putting your money where your mouth is".

However, betting only works in areas where [[extraverted thinking]] applies: propositions that are susceptible to a simple, empirical test that delivers a result that everyone can easily agree on. Most of what motivates tainting T with F (or vice versa) is the kind of idea that can't be tested so easily. [[Index|Type Guesses]] are a trivial example. Better examples include scientific theories like relativity. Such theories can't be tested: they are just more insightful ways of looking at the world, making it possible to frame testable propositions in new ways.

As an aside: One of the neat things about relativity is that it could be tested. Another neat thing about it is that an opportunity to test it came along just a year or so (plus or minus) after it was published. The test came back positive for relativity. (Special or general, I forget which). Relativity, String theory, etc... are aggregations of mutually depending statements. Disprove one and you disprove the entire theory. A new theory needs to be made up that encompasses the new data and whatever was correct with the old model. Lenore p.234 para.2, p.230 para.3 or para.4 (depending on how you count the paragraphs).

#### Summarizing understanding

Another exception is making a first-person declaration as a summary of how things currently seem to you, given the totality of your present understanding. The wording might be the same, but the meaning is different: it's part of a conversation framed in more introverted terms, the object being to improve understanding rather than to immediately settle a matter or make a group decision. In those circumstances, saying "here's where I am now" is just a way of letting the other person into your mind a little, so you can collectively decide how to proceed in the conversation (choose a new angle from which to view the topic, etc.).

Such summaries often don't come out as first-person declarations, though. A way to word them so they aren't confused with [[extraverted feeling]] declarations is to say "currently" or similar wording: "My current thinking is that the Red Sox have a stronger pitching staff than any other team in the league." (Of course, any wording can be used—or abused—to suggest almost any meaning, even one directly contrary to the words.)

This kind of summary is not an attempt to persuade or even offer an idea for consideration. It's just a way of getting in sync with someone else in a conversation, so they can know what new idea or consideration would be most fruitful to talk about next.

## A corollary?

A _corollary_ is that anything ever stated or expressed is a declaration of feeling (more appropriately, a declaration of emotion, or caused by emotional turmoil), as taking action can generally (if not always) be reduced to emotions or pre-emotive reflex.

### Against this corollary

Indeed, everything that we ever do is a manifestation of some desire. But that doesn't mean that the *subject matter* of every statement is feeling or emotion or the underlying desire. "This screw has a Phillips head" is a statement about the screw, not the person making the statement. Taking an F attitude would be to orient by the person's desire and not by the content. Taking a T attitude would be to give priority to the content.

The point of distinguishing first-person declarations from other forms of expression is that first-person declarations make the speaker and his feelings into the subject matter.

For example, if someone disagrees with you about the screw, and you say, "Well *I say* the screw has a Phillips head!", now you are the subject of the sentence, not the screw. You're declaring where you stand on a particular point of interpersonal conflict. At this point, the conversation has shifted from being about the shape of the screw head to getting the other person to back down.

As noted in the main text, explicit use of a first-person pronoun is not absolutely necessary to make a first-person declaration, though. Sometimes context makes clear that the speaker is making a declaration about himself rather than pointing out a fact or sharing an idea.

Would an ego-based function be more likely to use a first-person declaration? (Thus when you state "I don't like it", etc... you are in the grip of an ego function (no matter whether your [[dominant function]] is ego-oriented or not). see also: [[Ego Orientation]], [[Superego Exegesis]].

""This screw has a Phillips head" is a statement about the screw, not the person making the statement." Is both a statement of the screw and the person making a statement, as why would a person make said statement in the first place? This is an ESPs view of the matter (Why would you do anything if it didn't apply to you, or your domain of interest?)

As per: "Well *I say* the screw has a Phillips head!": There is someone who would consider the person's perceptions to be more the subject of the sentence, even though the person's perceptions aren't specifically referred to in the sentence. There is a difference between purposefully trying to get someone to back down, and just having an abrasive interpersonal style. Figuring out which is which is another thing entirely. (There is someone who suspects that the two correlate strongly, though someone who normally is domineering may use the same style when actually attempting to impersonally dialogue)
