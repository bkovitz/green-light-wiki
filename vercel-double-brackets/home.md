[[Lenore Thomson]] is the author of [Personality Type: An Owner's Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Personality-Type-Practical-Understanding-Yourself-ebook/dp/B00KLFBMKG), a book that takes the [[Myers Briggs|Myers-Briggs]] personality type system back to its roots in [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] psychology. Or perhaps redefines [[Myers Briggs|Myers-Briggs]] as a vocabulary for analyzing politics and public discourse. We don't really know. On this web site, we try to figure out what she's talking about. You're invited to help (see below).

## About this web site

[[Lenore Thomson]]'s book is simply written, filled with examples and analogies from popular TV shows like Star Trek and The X Files. Even so, it can be maddeningly difficult to understand. She touches on a wide range of deep and broad topics from ancient philosophy to Sufism to contemporary pop culture. She seems to have something very definite in mind by her many [[terms with nonobvious meanings]]. She never really quite defines them, though, and it's difficult to pin down her meaning.

[[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]] is the first popular author to go into depth about what the [[Function Attitude|function attitudes]] are, and she turns [[Myers Briggs|Myers-Briggs]] from a system of personality classification to a path of personal growth, something like the [Enneagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/main/Enneagram_of_Personality). Her book might also be a vocabulary of mental [heuristics](https://web.archive.org/web/20071215002147/http://greenlightwiki.com/heuristic), a unified view of many conflicting strands of philosophic thought (perhaps what [[Carl Jung]] intended), and an analysis of how and why people's rhetorical expectations sometimes clash. We don't really know quite what to make of her book—hence this web site.

This wiki is a place where we explore what [[Lenore Thomson]] is talking about by trying to put it into our own words—[exegesis](/wiki/main/fundamentals/exegesis). The text on this wiki is written by anyone who cares to post, and edited and rewritten by anyone who cares to edit and rewrite. We welcome all [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]]-related ideas: what's posted here is not necessarily correct, it's not checked or approved by [[Lenore Thomson]], and it's not necessarily any clearer than [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]]'s original writing. If you find what looks like an internal contradiction here, it probably is. We make no attempt to be consistent; we're looking for many different angles on [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]]'s stuff. The only [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]]-related topic we're not interested in is judgements of whether her ideas are right or wrong. We leave that to the reader.
