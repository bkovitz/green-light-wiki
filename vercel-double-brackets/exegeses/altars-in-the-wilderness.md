## Abraham in the desert

It *might* be an allusion to Abraham wandering around the desert staking out territory for his God. Almost all religions in the Middle East at the time assumed that their gods were confined to spacial neighborhoods of influence, and erecting altars wherever you went was a way to invite your God to follow you around.

But how would that be an analogy for [[Extraverted Intuition|Ne]]?

Speculative answer #1. First, I'm not a theologian, but I think that Abraham would have said he was being led by God rather than having God follow. With that said, "the wilderness" could refer to the uncharted territory of future possibility. Both the present and the past could be said to be "tamed" in a sense because there are many physical and social structures and artifacts with which one may orient oneself. In contrast "the wild" can be a lonesome place where one can become easily disoriented and where one is likely to be exposed to unknown influences.

Speculative answer #2. A central theme in the biblical story of Abraham is sacrifice. Physical sacrifice rituals in Abraham's time were often conducted on altars which were sometimes located in geographical places which were endowed with unique topology and attributed with spiritual significance. Thus access could have been restricted to certain people or through specific pathways which could mean that the Ne may idealise him/herself as on a kind of quest or becoming with the pay off in the future rather than the past or present. [[Extraverted Intuition]] by definition demands some self-sacrifice (ego sacrifice?) in that it recognizes others rights to exist as individuals. If one views the purpose of sacrifice not as much to nourish or revitalize an individual, but rather to nourish or revive a relationship; then perhaps the author suggests like Kiersey in Please Understand Me II, (promethus, 1998) that the Ne function is forward looking/thinking and identity-seeking and drives social reconcilliation, collaboration and co-operation.

Speculative answer #3. Depending on the ratio of [[Dominant Function|dominant]] Ne's to the population, the author may be suggesting that they may feel isolated from the rest of society when reflecting upon a series of past episodes of intense and highly focused activity that could have resulted in little evidence of immediate material gain. Could the image of an altar in the wilderness suggest abandonment of self-identity or a release from responsibility?

Notes: ans 1, 2, 3 based on personal insights of one ENFP, hope it is helpful.

## Specified vs. Non-Specified Context

Ne can be said to be contextual as all intuition is, but non-specified. The altar to the Gods doesn't depend upon a pre-defined framework. Ne takes things as they come. Ne merges with implicit possibility. Changing the terrain sprouts up new altars.

[[Introverted Intuition|Ni]] can be said to be contextual as all intuition is, but specified. A temple to the Gods depends upon a pre-defined framework. [[Introverted Intuition|Ni]] discriminates implicit possibility. Changing the terrain changes the view on the temple.
