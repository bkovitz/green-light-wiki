_Hypothesis_: A major difference between [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]]'s theory and [[David Keirsey]]'s theory (and many other four-letter code theories) is that in Lenore's theory, the four-letter codes don't stand for "character archetypes" or "temperaments".

Character archetypes are roles that people identify with: for example, the fun-loving good ol' boy type, the dreamy idealistic crusader for spiritual consciousness type, the mad scientist wizard type, the dutiful pillar of tradition and community type. Keirsey names these four character archetypes Artisan, Idealist, Rational, and Guardian, and proposes that:

- (a) each person has one and only one definite, clear-cut character archetype from this set, and
- (b) a person's character archetype is a matter of innate temperament.

Keirsey associates each of his "four temperaments" to two letters from a four-letter code: Artisan is SP, Idealistic is NF, Rational is NT, and Guardian is SJ.

Keirsey also associates finer-grained character archetypes with each four-letter code. His names for these have changed over the years (along with his names for his four temperaments). Some examples are: INFJ is Counselor, ENFP is Advocate or Champion, INFP is Healer, ENFJ is Teacher. Keirsey seems to say that there are discontinuities between temperaments (no gradual continuum from one temperament to another) but a continuum between "characters" within the same temperament, and that change of four-letter code within a temperament is possible but change of temperament is not.

Lenore's theory does not identify character archetypes with four-letter codes. In Lenore's theory, a person who lives out the "Amazon" character archetype (orienting primarily by feminine power) can be an ENFP, or an ISTJ, or any other four-letter code. And an ENFP can be an Amazon, a Mother, a Mediatrix, or a Companion. (When Lenore talks of character archetypes, she usually uses the [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] set.)

Lenore's four-letter codes simply have to do with [[Function Attitude|function attitudes]], and function attitudes are conflicting ways of [[orienting]] to the signs we find in the world, resulting from different ways that the brain represents the same information. See [[Truth And Language Exegesis|Truth-and-Language Exegesis]] and [[Parliament of Attitudes]].

The fact that Keirsey and Lenore are referring to such radically different things by the same four-letter codes creates classification mismatches. See [[Definition Problem]].

## Example: Odysseus

From the standpoint of archetypes, Odysseus would superficially seem like an ENTJ because of his leadership and heroism. Yet from the standpoint of the Lenore-attitudes, he obviously doesn't fit into that category. Odysseus is known as the "man of many wiles," and he is good at manipulating people. He is also identified with metis, a type of creative and androgynous cunning. An example of his cunning is the infamous Trojan Horse. The Trojan Horse subverts a symbol of defeat, and turns it into victory; it turns the Trojan ritual celebrations into a night of slaughter. This subversion of [[Judgement|Je]] suggests that Odysseus is a TP rather than a TJ. Another example of [[Inferior Function|inferior]] [[Extraverted Feeling|Fe]] could be the way that Odysseus couldn't resist telling the Cyclops his name.

These factors suggest that Odysseus is an ITP, maybe even an INTP. Yet archetypal ITPs are very different from Odysseus. Specifically, archetypal INTPs are thought of as philosophers or scientists, like Albert Einstein and stereotypical INTPs are thought of as geeks and nerds. Yet Odysseus is neither of these.
