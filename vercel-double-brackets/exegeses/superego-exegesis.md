## A Freudian exegesis

### Id, Ego, Superego

Fe and Te are superego functions.

Se and Ne are ego functions.

If you truly do not have a sense of self as distinct, you truly do not have an ego. If a [[Function Attitude|function-attitude]] as a dominant does not have a sense of self as unique (and thus uniquely important), that [[Function Attitude|function-attitude]] is not an ego-attitude. (That is, if your dominant function is not an ego-function, you're going to have to hit another function for a sense of ego. â€” that is, [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]] to experiment with their ability to stay up late and play hard, ETJs[^2] hitting their tertiary as a means to just quit regardless of the consequences, etc....)

When functioning as a dominant, a superego function (that is, [[Extraverted Feeling]]) will not be oriented by the self.

### Another hypothesis

The [[Secondary Function]] is the means by which a person orients himself to the superego. It follows that the [[Tertiary Function]] is the means by which a person orients himself to the id, while the actual contents of the id (unconscious) are accessed via the [[Inferior Function]].

[[Extraverted Feeling|^1]: Collective term for types who use [Extraverted Feeling]] (Fe) as their [[Dominant Function]] attitude.

[[Extraverted Thinking|^2]: Collective term for types who use [Extraverted Thinking]] (Te) as their [[Dominant Function]] attitude.
