A _Type Clash_ is a misunderstanding or conflict that occurs due to differing [[Function Attitude|function-attitudes]], often between two opposing axes[^1].

If you have experienced an argument where everything seems to be going over the other person's head (and vice-versa), you have experienced Type Clash.

## Why does Type Clash happen?

Type Clash happens when a type assumes another type has the same [[Semiotic Attitude|Semiotic Attitudes]]. When a person's semiotic attitude is too different from another, it may as well be a foreign language.

One person's "Let's grab a coffee this Saturday" could be a statement that reflects they are _open_ to this plan and enjoys their current relationship with the other person; another could view this statement as a definitive plan to pencil it in for Saturday.

They are assigning different meanings to the same sign. So when these two chat, they will likely misunderstand each other and create a type conflict. "It's Saturday but you didn't follow up on the plans at all? Didn't you say we should grab a coffee today?" So on and so forth. You say bow-wow and I hear meow-meow. A throwaway sign of affection becomes evidence of flakiness.

What is "meaningless" and what is "meaningful" is often tied to [[Index|Introversion and Extraversion]]. Introverted [[Function Attitude|attitudes]] are more personal due to their [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|subjective]] nature and Extraverted [[Function Attitude|attitudes]] are more impersonal due to their [[Terms With Nonobvious Meanings|objective]] nature.

For example, a [[Judgement|Je]] user makes a sweeping statement off-the-cuff in a discussion. The Je user views their statement as a matter of efficiencyâ€”if it works in this context, it works. It doesn't matter if it's not universally applicable or not. The [[Judgement|Ji]] user views the Je user's actions as imprecise, too generalised and lacking nuance because it does not follow a principle; the statement may not apply under different contexts or situations.

The Je user will think of the Ji user's need to clarify or refine the Je user's statement as pedantic and annoying. The Ji user will see the Je user as [[Shallowness|shallow]] and narrow minded.

## Variations of Type Clashes

### Feeling and Thinking

[[Feeling]] views actions as an expression of personal _value_ (e.g. wants, needs, identity, etc.) to a person. While [[Thinking]] views actions impersonally, simply as what they are within a system. The type clash between Feeling and Thinking is really a type clash between interpreting things personally vs. impersonally.

Feeling vs. Thinking type clashes often occur due to: A Feeler assuming a Thinker's statement is a reflection of their personal beliefs; or a Thinker assuming a Feeler's statement is a reflection of their understanding of the world.

Stereotypes about women and men in relationships often demonstrate the [[Feeling]] vs. [[Thinking]] clash respectively. If you are unfamiliar with this trope, read ahead.

Imagine a Feeler has experienced a frustrating day at work. The Feeler returns home to complain about their day to the Thinker. The Feeler's desire is to express what this workday represents in relation to their emotions, values, and needs. Perhaps they feel overworked, perhaps they are uncertain if this is a good working environment, etc. The Thinker, then, focusing on this as an impersonal problem to be solved enters problem solving mode: "Let's try doing _x_. Have you considered _y_? Are you certain _z_ isn't an option?"

The impersonal response from the Thinker to the Feeler's bid for a personal response is read as a slight: "They aren't focusing on what I think and feel about the situation and skipping right to the end. They don't care about me at all!" The Thinker is then taken aback by the emotional response at _helping_ the Feeler solve their problem. They will then likely think to themselves: "They're completely unreasonable. All I wanted to do is help and they're flying off the handle."

See [[Why Cant You Share Your Feelings|Why Can't You Share Your Feelings]] for Thinking vs. Feeling clashes in regard to displays of emotion.

### Introverted Thinking vs. Extraverted Thinking

See [[King on the Mountain]] and [[Lowest Common Denominator Logic|Lowest-Common-Denominator Logic]].

### Introverted Feeling vs. Extraverted Feeling

Fi values the individual over the group and Fe values the group over the individual. One feeling attitude often assumes the other function is operating under the same rules. During a Fi vs. Fe clash, Fi can view the Fe as inauthentic, shallow, and overbearing; and Fe can view Fi as selfish, egocentric, and insensitive.

_Example 1_: A group of friends are deciding on where to have lunch. Nobody in this group has a preferred place so they pick a Greek restaurant at random. The ESFP is against this because they dislike Greek food and would prefer a different restaurant. The ISFJ sees this as self-centered because the ESFP is pushing to change the group's decision over ESFP's personal preferences. From the perspective of the ESFP, nobody felt strongly about the Greek restaurant anyway (Fi) so they shouldn't agree to something impractical for them (Te).

_Example 2_: An ENFP witnesses an INFJ speaking to different groups of people. The INFJ in one group agrees with someone who says that abortions are a right. In another group, the INFJ agrees with a different person that abortion could be considered a form of murder. The ENFP sees this as fake because the INFJ is agreeing with (seemingly) conflicting viewpoints of others. From the INFJ's perspective, they are taking the time to consider alternate viewpoints (Ti) in a way that makes others feel heard (Fe).

#### Fi landmine

The [[Introverted Feeling|Fi]] landmine is when someone violates an Fi user's values, which leads to the Fi user becoming very unhappy. Sometimes there is prior knowledge of this, sometimes not. It is difficult to understand for types who do not use Fi or have underdeveloped Fi.

Example: ENFJ mentions that they don't think a banana taped to a wall constitutes as art. INFP, who is very passionate about post-modern art, reacts angrily to this statement and believes ENFJ to be shallow and uncultured.

#### Fe social contract

The [[Extraverted Feeling|Fe]] social contract is a set of rules that may or may not be explicitly defined by the parties involved. When this contract is violated, the Fe user will become quite unhappy. It is difficult to understand for types who do not use Fe or have underdeveloped Fe.

Example: ISFP buys his wife a necklace for their anniversary. However, ESFJ thinks that the necklace is not expensive enough and thus is a statement that says: I do not care about you enough to spend more money on you. ESFJ then resents ISFP and thinks of him as an inconsiderate husband.

This article is worth fleshing out due to how often type conflicts occur. I've done my best to create a skeleton for this page but it requires more analysis and examples. - April
