We can take any [[Function Attitude|function-attitude]] we like, but a [[Function Attitude|function-attitude]] that we follow to create a sense of self is to some considerable extent creating us. It's defining our conscious perspective, our understanding of who "I" am and what "I" care about and why "I" am doing what I'm doing.

_Te:_ What are _my_ goals, _my_ criteria of progress and success? How shall _I_ constrain affairs to ensure that those goals come about?

_Ti:_ _I_ must understand for _myself_ based on reasoning that _I_ grasp first-hand. _I_ will have to play around with it _myself_ so that the way it makes sense becomes clear to _my_ mind.

_Fe:_ What network of obligations am _I_ bound into? How will this affect or define _my_ relationships with other people?

_Fi:_ What is alive here and what are its needs, and what does unconditional moral principle call upon _me_ to do about it? What will make _my_ soul pure?

_Se:_ What is _my_ gut reaction right now, regardless of past, future, or faraway circumstances? What impulse do _I_ feel like following right this second? What image shall _I_ create (what gut reaction shall _I_ produce in others)?

_Si:_ What enduring things and concerns am _I_ anchored to, regardless of changing circumstances? What can _I_ always find by knowing to look for it? What can _I_ depend on in a world that is mostly unknown and changing?

_Ne:_ How can _I_ change the game? How can _I_ open up the unknown and thereby change our understanding of what's before us right now?

_Ni:_ What is _my own_ way of seeing things, independent of influences such as other people's ideas, other people's expectations, my culture, my language, or reality itself?

Relentlessly asking and answering these questions, we form an ego. We eventually believe that the "I" of one of these sentences is what we are, and any other "I" is a threat to our very integrity as a person.

Learning about [[Function Attitude|function attitudes]] widens our conscious perspective so that we no longer understand ourselves solely in terms of one of these. When different [[Function Attitude|function attitudes]] no longer seem like a threat, we can call widely upon our talents and still maintain personal integrity.

## An opposing idea?

Note: The Ego is not necessarily the dominant agent in each function. [[Extraverted Feeling]] is innately a superego function.

Superego orientation:

Fe: What are the expectations of those in my group and my society? What obligations and thoughts do I owe them?

Ne: What can I contribute to those around me? What skills, ideas and talents do I have that would improve their condition?

Note: These descriptions nearly mirror those above. Highlighting "Me" and "I" doesn't make the statements solely about ego. Highlighting the attributes that each focus on would (ie. in [[Extraverted Feeling|Fe]]: "Network of obligations", "relationships", etc...), possibly, would need to deconstruct it further.

See [[Superego Exegesis]].

### Against this opposing idea: Terminology clarification

Actually, "me" and "I" above do make the statements at the beginning of this page solely about the ego, because all that's meant by "ego" is your sense of "me" and "I". No doubt some people use the word "ego" to mean other things. Please don't let that distract you from the idea being proposedâ€”which is indeed that "type" as [[Lenore Thomson|Lenore]] uses the word has to do strictly with which [[Function Attitude|function attitudes]] create a sense of "I".
